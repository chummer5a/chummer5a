WebService Changes:

- added the ability to create a group (with name)
- found a bug that prevented uploading for none-admins (damn - I'm just used to have all the rights...)


Application Changes:

- added the ability to create a group.
- added a "Archetype"-Checkbox for ArchetypeAdmins only (including a name)

Build 1.0.0.1

WebService Changes:

- added some telemetry data events and traces (only into the WebServer - no phoneing home in the client)
- patched a Bug in handling different SINners with the same Id. That should not happen, unless people are editing the Guids directly - but nethertheless, they can be deleted now withouth Primary Key constraints.
- implemented AdminGetSinners to create a backup of the whole Database. Plz note, that the Chummerfiles themself are NOT affected because they are on GDrive
- changed the initial search for the SINners by Authorization: SINners are grouped now: edit, group, view
- fixed a bug were the check if a Chummer is already on GDrive used the new uploaded (and always empty) GDriveID from the Client - now this ID is kept from the database if it's empty on upload (which it SHOULD be)
- added a DeploymentSlot "Beta" for Azure reachable under https://sinners-beta.azurewebsites.net/ - doubles the cost, halves the chance of me messing things up in production later
- fixed a Bug where Properties were not updated in the Database on POST
- Files at GDrive are checked for existance before uploading and are only updated, if they exist
- added ApplicationInsights Livetracking to see what's going on in the Azure Portal
- added a Role "ConfirmedUser" (Email Address confirmed) for future use (maybe allow versioning only for these users?)
- set the daily Data-Volume Cap to 1GB (for now, can be raised - just to avoid unpleasant surprises)
- DELETE now actually deletes all database-entries in every table, not only the head.
- fixed a bug, where Tags where only added but not removed if not present anymore on a sinner
- added Flat Tags for better searchability (only on the server and hidden)
- Tags now have a Property "TagComment", which should help to find errors (Debugging)
- SinnerID is set in every tag now
- wiped the Database clean (because it WAS really messed up)
- added function GetDeleteAndRecreateDb() for cases where it's really messed up
- added basic validation in the Post WebService function in SinnersController
- changed LastChange (Sinner-Property) from DateTime? to DateTime

Application Changes:

- added a backup and restore-Button for Admins in the Options-Dialog (working, but no visual feedback)
- Online-Sinners are now shown as part of their "group": edit, group(name), view. This will be extended with "search", as soon as it is implemented
- changed FileSaveElement (now SINnerMetaData is serialized, so that the Mugshot is not stored twice in the save-file)
- added http://sinners-beta.azurewebsites.net/ to the selectable SINnerUrls
- OnSave checkes first, if the uploaded version is already up to date and either skips upload or does it
- frmWebBrowser closes after successfull login and saves the users EMail in his Visibility-Object
- fixed a bug, where the upload DID finish, but the execution of the program didn't resume
- Added the "Extra" for each HubClassTagAttribute (so that Increase [Attribute] gets a + WIL-Childtag)
- Show TagComment in the TreeNodeList of the Tags
- HubClassTags saves it's children in the Comment (SourceID should be enough to identify it)
- tweaked Login/Logout (no spamming of frmWebBrowser anymore)
- TagType was not set correctly in the TagExtractor-Reflection
- SinnerId is taken into account after the first POST to the WebService
- moved Uploadfunction into CharacterExtended
- added a ToolTip to the Online-Treenode in case something goes wrong with the ChummerHub-Query
- reworked Multi-Upload Button in Options-Dialog
- Fixed NullReferenceException when no spell was selected in the Sinner-Search dialog.
- added Changelog ;)
