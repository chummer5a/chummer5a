Chummer is a character generator for Shadowrun 5th Edition. Not only can you create your character quickly and easily, but you can also use Chummer during your character's shadowrunning career, to accurately track your Karma, Nuyen, ammo, and everything else all in one place. Chummer also includes support for a number of optional rules and house rules and even includes support for critters and is useful for players and Game Masters alike! It also supports four languages: English, French, German, and Japanese.

Chummer is continuously updated to address bugs and introduce new and interesting features suggested by the community. If you have a bug to report or idea to suggest, please add a new issue request [here](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/issues)

This project picks up from the projects Chummer and Chummer5, character generator programs for Shadowrun 4th and 5th editions, respectively.
