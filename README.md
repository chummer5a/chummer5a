## Basic Overview

Chummer is a character creation and management application for the tabletop RPG [Shadowrun, Fifth Edition](https://www.shadowruntabletop.com/products-page/getting-started/shadowrun-fifth-edition) running on Windows. Not only can you create your character quickly and easily, but you can also use Chummer during your character's shadowrunning career, to accurately track your Karma, Nuyen, ammo, and everything else all in one place. Chummer also includes support for a number of optional rules and house rules and even includes support for critters and is useful for players and Game Masters alike! It also supports four languages: English, French, German, and Japanese.

## Requirements
| Operating System | .Net Framework |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 8.1+ | 4.7.1+ |

## Installation

Chummer uses a single tree release strategy with two release channels; **Milestone** and **Nightly**.

* **Milestone** releases are a fixed-point for use by living communities and people that prefer not to update their application regularly. These releases are considered to be stable and are recommended for general use. 
* **Nightly** releases are an automated build created with Appveyor at 0000 UTC daily. These releases are more likely to be unstable, but also receive new features and bugfixes faster than the Milestone releases. These are recommended for users that have a specific issue from Milestone that was resolved in Nightly, or are comfortable with testing features. 

1. Download the archive for your preferred update channel [Milestone](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/releases/latest) or [Nightly](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/releases) (Select the latest Nightly tag)
2. Extract to preferred folder location. If upgrading, you can extract over the top of an existing folder path.
3. Run Chummer5.exe.
