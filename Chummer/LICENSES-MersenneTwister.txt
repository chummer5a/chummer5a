=====================================================================================
MT19937ar-cok
-------------

This is a Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator
with period 2^19937-1 with improved initialization scheme,
modified on 2002/2/10 by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto. 
This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization, 
Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.

MT19937-64
----------

A C-program for MT19937-64 (2014/2/23 version).
Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

This is a 64-bit version of Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number
generator.

Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand64(seed)  
or init_by_array64(init_key, key_length).
