## <a id="categories"></a>Categories Node

**category** (required): the name of the Vehicle Category. This list populates the Category list found in the Select Vehicle window. Categories are used to group Vehicles into groups such as _Groundcraft_, _Aircraft_, and _Drones_.

## <a id="modcategories"></a>Mod Categories Node

**category** (required): the name of the Vehicle Modification Category. This list populates the Category list found in the Select Vehicle Modification window.

## <a id="vehicles"></a>Vehicle Node

**id** (required): the internal name of the Vehicle. All ID fields are standard GUIDs, which can be generated by [external websites](https://www.guidgenerator.com) or plugins.

**name** (required): the name of the Vehicle.

**category** (required): the Category that this Vehicle belongs to. This must match one of the Categories defined in the [**Categories** Node](#categories "Categories Node").

**source** (required): the code for the Sourcebook that this entry comes from. See [books.xml](Books "books.xml").

**page** (required): the page number this item can be found on in the Sourcebook.

**handling** (required): the Vehicle's Handling attribute.

**speed** (required): the Vehicle's Speed attribute.

**accel** (required): the Vehicle's Acceleration attribute.

**body** (required): the Vehicle's Body attribute.

**armor** (required): the Vehicle's Armor attribute.

**pilot** (required): the Vehicle's Pilot attribute.

**sensor** (required): the Vehicle's Sensor attribute.

**avail** (required): the Availability of the Vehicle.

**cost** (required): the Cost of the Vehicle.

## <a id="mods"></a>Vehicle Modification Node

**id** (required): the internal name of the Vehicle Modification. All ID fields are standard GUIDs, which can be generated by [external websites](https://www.guidgenerator.com) or plugins.

**name** (required): the name of the Vehicle Modification.

**category** (required): the Category that this Vehicle Modification belongs to. This must match one of the Categories defined in the [**Mod Categories** Node](#modcategories "Mod Categories Node").

**source** (required): the code for the Sourcebook that this entry comes from. See [books.xml](Books "books.xml").

**page** (required): the page number this item can be found on in the Sourcebook.

**avail** (required): the Availability of the Vehicle Modification.

**cost** (required): the Cost of the Vehicle Modification.

**rating** (required): the Rating of the Vehicle Modification.

**slots** (required): the number of modification slots this Vehicle Modification uses.

**capacity** (optional): the Capacity provided by this Vehicle Modification.

**conditionmonitor** (optional): the Condition Monitor bonus/penalty provided by this Vehicle Modification.

**downgrade** (optional): if present, indicates this Vehicle Modification is a downgrade for drone attributes.

**useownattributesforweapon** (optional): if set to `True`, indicates that weapons mounted in this drone arm should use the arm's own Agility attribute instead of the vehicle's Pilot Rating for Agility-based tests. This implements the rule from Rigger 5, p125 that states: "If the drone is using the arm for a test that would normally be Agility-based, use the limb's Agility, rather than the drone's Pilot Rating."

**subsystems** (optional): defines which cyberware subsystems can be installed in this Vehicle Modification. Contains one or more **subsystem** elements.

**required** (optional): defines requirements that must be met for this Vehicle Modification to be available. See [required nodes](Custom-Data-Files#required-nodes "Custom Data Files").

**optionaldrone** (optional): if present, indicates this Vehicle Modification is optional for drones.
