      <text>This ruleset overhauls the entire character creation system and replaces it with one that is both much more balanced and much less punishing for those who go for stranger builds. The entire priority table has been overhauled, Sum-to-Ten rules and metatype costs and special quality costs have been overhauled, and every single item that could be used for karma discounts of some kind was overhauled to have a different effect.\n\nTo view the full details of this ruleset, go to this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pCoHXLAf7bWLE4trdAsKI7qrLq4QXlsW7W4K4jEka-8/. </text>
