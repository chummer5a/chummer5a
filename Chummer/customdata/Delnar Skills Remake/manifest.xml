      <text>This ruleset overhauls the entire Skills system and replaces it with the 5th Edition-Like version of Delnar_Ersike's Active Skills Remake. The remake is meant to fix a lot of the issues and nebulousness that comes with the rules for skills in Shadowrun 5th edition.\n\nTo view the full details of this remake, go to this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Km8Os33xNXZK8MFLiwn1CUG_sDzGC8WYaBlKokJkHrQ/. </text>
