      <text>This ruleset fixes Sum-to-Ten character creation by increasing the value of A priorities from 4 to 7 and increasing the value of B priorities from 3 to 4. This ensures that builds that need Sum-to-Ten to work, usually ork-, dwarf-, and troll-based builds, do not get punished for straying the standard ABCDE arrangement.\n\nWhen using these new values, it is highly recommended to increase your Sum-to-Ten value from 14 to 10. Staying at 10 is only advisable if you want a more street-level game of ca. 700 starting karma value.</text>
