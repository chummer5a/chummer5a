      <disadvantage>When a Boar magician makes a plan, she sticks to it. You must make a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test to abandon a planned course of action in favor of a new one. If you fail, you must endeavor to continue with your original plan, even if it means going on alone. Similarly, you must succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test to proceed in anything without a plan.</disadvantage>
