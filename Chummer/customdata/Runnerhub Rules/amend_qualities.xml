Other types of magic usage without a license are fine under the text of the quality.

      <name>Restricted Gear</name>
      <notes>
        - This quality requires explicit CCD approval and may be denied without further comment.
        - In general it is more likely to be approved when used for flavorful gear that ties well into a character's background, whereas attempts to simply use it to maximize a character's power are very likely to be denied.
        - Either way, CCD always has final say whether the quality may be used or not.

        - This quality applies to any weapon, including unarmed attacks.
        - The advantage halves the penalty for any called shot. When combined with other ways to reduce the penalty, the penalty is halved after the other reductions have been applied.
        - Keep in mind the drawback: You must make called shots unless you are using some other form of special attack (such as suppressing fire, multiple attacks, or nerve strike). This is not optional.

      - Custom codes of honor are not allowed at chargen. If you would like to take this quality in character creation, you must select from one of the already defined codes of honor in the books (Like a Boss, etc.) 
      Nationalist:
      - This quality is allowed for UCAS only.
      - CCD may deny characters with this quality submitted to r/hubchargen without comment.
      - It is strongly advised that characters with this quality also have the National SINner: UCAS quality. 
      Thug Life:
      - The expenses (half your income) are treated the same way as a SIN tax: they apply to your direct run rewards, and do not affect Working for the Man/People.

    <quality>
      <name>Code of Honor: Like a Boss</name>
      <notes>
      - The Code of Honor is also violated if a sprite or agent under the player’s control causes matrix damage to a target.
      - It doesn’t extend to physical actions that cause matrix damage (e.g. using electric attacks against drones).

      <name>Dead Emotion</name>
      <notes>
        - The chosen emotion requires explicit sheet team approval, and the player should work with the sheet team to figure out how it affects the character and then note it on the character’s sheet.
        - This quality doesn’t make a character immune to artificially induced emotions (e.g. through a critter’s Fear power) - it’s still a negative quality, after all.

    <quality>
      <name>Driven</name>
      <notes>
        - Whatever a character's driving force is, it has to have a specific end goal that must be realistically possible to work towards and achieve in play on the 'hub. Once this goal has been achieved, the quality has to be bought off immediately.
        - Whether any given goal fulfills these criteria is subject to the sheet team's discretion. 
      </notes>

    <quality>
      <name>Distinctive Style</name>
      <notes>
        - The character has 2 Public Awareness that can only be removed when buying off the quality.
        - If the character covers, removes, or otherwise hides what makes their style distinctive, they take a -1 penalty to all actions until they uncover/wear/show their style.
        - Characters who have this quality as a consequence of a metagenetic quality or from being a metavariant do not suffer the penalty when hiding their style and do not have the additional Public Awareness, and suffer only the RAW ramifications of this quality.

      <notes>
        - On character submission the player needs to provide a list of the corporations that have the files, along with what specific information the corporation holds on the character and why they have those records.
        - This list should be adequately explained in the character's background section on their character sheet, and must be thematically appropriate to the background of the character. 
        - This quality is limited to 3 ranks (or 3 corporations) at character creation.
