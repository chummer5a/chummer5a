			<name>Cyberlimb Optimization</name>
			<notes>
				- This can be taken for the arms with any Weapon skill and in such a case they will apply to the weapon's Accuracy. Any weapon can be wielded in 2 hands (even knives and holdout pistols ) unless the circumstances dictate otherwise (e.g. carrying something in your off-hand, dual-wielding, trying to use a weapon in the same initiative pass as a Right Back At Ya! action, etc.) Other uses of Cyberlimb Optimization are still case-by-case.
