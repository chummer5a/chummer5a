      <text>This ruleset adds a splatbook that adds eight positive qualities that cost only cost one karma and three negative qualities that only provide one karma. One karma qualities are unfortunately quite absent from Shadowrun 5th edition, and these additions remedy that absence.\n\nTo view the full details of this remake, go to this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XZTJzImQ5m6N9lRrjbnCKD8AspYpZOWeaY1-3p0zrsU/. </text>
