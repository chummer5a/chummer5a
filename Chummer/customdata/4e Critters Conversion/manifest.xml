        <text>This ruleset is currently not functional. It presently exists as a backup file for the unused 4e critters previously stored in critters.xml. Inside of an amends file, they exist with the intent that going forward, a larger project can be done to try and convert their stats to be usable if someone wishes to enable them via amends.</text>
