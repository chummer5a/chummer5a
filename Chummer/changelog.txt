- Added the ability for contact selection improvements to make a contact free.

- Fixed an issue where copying and pasting gear that adds weapons would not properly link the new instances of the pasted weapons with the new instance of the pasted gear.
- Added the ability to copy and paste 'ware of all types. As with other copy-paste code, copying can be done from any character, while pasting only works with characters in create mode.
- Fixed an issue where shared Condition Monitor threshold offsets did not properly account for improvements that allowed condition monitor penalties to be ignored or overarching threshold offsets.
- Fixed an issue where A.I. characters would have traditional condition monitor information displayed, both in Chummer5a and on character sheets, instead of condition monitor information based on their home node.
- Fixed an issue where A.I. characters could receive wound penalties from Matrix condition monitor damage.
- Initiation/Submersion Grades can now print their notes in thge option to do so is enabled, and any Arts, Enhancements or Metamagics/Echoes are included as child nodes. Sheets will still need to be adjusted to accommodate this.
- Fixed an issue where the Fancy Blocks character sheet did not format sprite optional powers and weaknesses correctly.
- Split up skillattribute improvement into skillattribute (which increases skill dicepools when using a particular skill) and skilllinkedattribute (which increases dicepools of skills linked to a particular attribute).

- When printing powers for spirits and sprites, Chummer5a will now also check critterpowers.xml in addition to spiritpowers.xml.
- Children or auxiliary weapons and vehicles that come pre-installed with an item will no longer show up in the UI if their sourcebooks are not enabled. Fixed #2503.
- Fixed a rare issue where adding certain items in create mode would generate expense log entries that stayed around afterwards and showed up in career mode. Affected characters with this issue in create mode will have it fixed retroactively, but the entry will remain for affected characters in career mode. Fixes #2507.
- Fixed an issue where drain and fading attributes were not translated on character sheets.
- Technomancer Streams can now be selected in the "Complex Forms and Spirits" tab if there is more than one stream present in the data files.

- Fixed an issue where encumbrance penalties to attributes would not be factored immediately into various displays, e.g. Physical limit.
- Drain attributes and drain values are now exposed to print methods as separate items, allowing sheets more control over how these should be displayed. The same applies to fading attributes and fading values.
- Fixed an issue where characters loaded into Chummer5a when their values for attribute loss from essence modifiers, wound modifiers, or encumbrance modifiers would be different than under the conditions in which they were originally saved would not have those modifiers updated unless they had a character tab opened for them as well (this primarily affected critters, spirits, and sprites with linked character files).

- Fixed a crash when altering the rating of knowsofts and lingasofts. Fixes #2514

- Fixed possible crashes that could occur when selecting an armor mod or weapon accessory that somehow does not have a parent set.
- Initiation is now allowed if the character is ignoring character creation rules.
- Fixed an issue where 'ware with a pair bonus that also needed a specified location would not properly add that pair bonus. Fixes #2500.
- Fixed an issue where re-applying improvements for 'ware that includes 'ware types other than its own when calculating members for its pair bonuses would not properly re-apply those pair bonuses.
- Fixed an issue where taking an item with a bonus that enables a special attribute in create mode would not properly account for essence-modifying bonuses when calculating special attribute loss from essence loss. Fixes #2508.
- Fixed an issue where taking knowsofts in a knowledge skill would also grant bonuses to active skills. Fixes #2518.
- Fixed an issue where skillsofts could grant ratings higher than the user's skilljack rating.
- Unhardcoded checks for skillsofts and activesofts. These bonuses can now be granted by any item, not just gear in the Skillsofts category. Note that existing characters with activesofts will need to manually re-apply improvements for them to work again, while existing characters with knowsofts and linguasofts should be automatically prompted to re-apply improvements for those pieces of gear alone.
- Added tooltips to knowledge skill controls that function similarly to those for active skill controls.
- Fixed the No Armor Encumbrance house rule from applying by default and not being changable through the UI.
- Added the ability to use groups in forbidden and required sections where the user is only required to have one of the items in the group (intended for use within "allof" nodes). These groups are processed via "grouponeof" nodes.
- Fixed an issue where trying to add plugins and/or notes to cyberware or children of cyberware in a vehicle would result in said plugin getting added to the selected node in the Cyberware tab.
- Fixed an issue where weapons accessories that altered the cost of additional weapons accessories (e.g. Vintage) would not work properly.
- Added a button to immediately delete the selected metamagic, initiation grade, art, enhancement, etc. in the metamagics tree instead of users having to always use the Delete button on their keyboard to perform the action.
- Unhardcoded skill selection in the weaponcategorydv bonus/improvement so that it is no longer always RAW melee combat active skills.

- Fixed an issue where gear that comes with a gear parent and has a set rating will use the maximum rating of the gear instead of the one specified in the data files. Fixes #2521.
- Fixed an issue where specifying extra gear children of a gear parent that comes with a gear grandparent would not work.
- Fixed an issue where the UI would not update with changes to skill specializations in career mode. Fixes #2522.
- Fixed an issue where Chummer5a did not comply with official errata that the number of complex forms a technomancer can learn at character generation cannot exceed twice their RES rating (it previously checked against their LOG rating).
- Fixed a crash that occurred when entering the "Karma and Nuyen" tab with a karma or nuyen entry whose date is set to sometime after the current date and time of the user, as well as when adding a karma or nuyen entry with a date set to sometime after the current date and time of the user. Fixes #2523, fixes #2519.
- When selecting children gear for items that only allow certain categories of gear children and that also have a fixed capacity for said items, only items that consume capacity and/or items in the Custom category (if eligible) are shown.
- Fixed an issue where changing the rating of a focus would not properly update the corresponding item in the focus list.
- Fixed an issue where deleting sprites or spirits from anywhere other than the end of their lists would not cause the remaining controls to move up and fill in the empty space.
- Removed the (currently non-functional) checkbox in the gear selection screen to make a grenade aerodynamic. Aerodynamic grenades now have separate gear entries.
- Fixed an issue where changing a character's primary hand would not set the flag telling Chummer5a that there have been changes to the character that need to be saved.
- Fixed an issue where increasing the quantity of gear in career mode would increase gear costs by the total cost of the current stack and then multiply costs by the current stack's quantity, instead of just increasing costs by the cost of the current stack's children and multiplying costs by the current stack's parent's quantity. Fixes #2527.
- Fixed an issue where two gear items with children of differing quantities could still be treated as if they were identical pieces of gear.
- If the updater fails to connect, it will now display the actual error that caused it to fail to connect.
- Fixed an issue where a knowledge skill specialization would automatically end up getting selected from the list of suggested specializations whenever that list changes.
- Fixed a bug where bonuses that would disallow specializations for active skills in career mode and/or knowledge skills in create or career modes would not work properly.
- Fixed Sprites and Spirits being created with RES/MAG*2 at creation incorrectly.
- Fixed a crash that would occur when toggling PP-related house rules in the Options menu. Fixes #2530.
- Fixed an issue where a spell's Limited and/or Extended status would not be properly reflected in the tooltip of its drain value.
- Removed the "GitHub Issues" tab from the Options menu in non-Debug builds, as it only contained the "Upload Pastebin" button, which is non-functional outside of Debug builds.
- Fixed an issue where spells and complex forms with drain exactly equal to drain and fading respectively would have their values displayed incorrectly.
- Fixed an issue where Chummer5a could not properly connect to GitHub for updates due to a change in GitHub's security protocols.
- Fixed various issues where bonuses/improvements that were skill-specific would not apply properly for exotic skills.
- Fixed an issue where a skill could display a negative dicepool size if negative modifiers were large enough.
- Fixed issues where tooltip texts for upgrading skills, attributes, and skill groups would not update properly.
- Fixed the check for 'High Art' initiations to not apply if Street Grimoire isn't being used.
- Fixed an issue where changes to special attribute loss amounts in career mode would cause any and all karma levels associated with that special attribute to get burned away every time the character is updated until all karma levels have been burned for them.
- Fixed an issue where canceling out of an "Add & More" prompt and then accepting a form through a method other than "Add & More" would still cause the form to think the user accepted the form via "Add & More".
- Fixed an occasional issue with skillgroups causing a crash due to missing skill skills.
- Implemented a number spinner for Mystic Adept Power Point costs.
- Implemented a DisplayAccuracy property for weapons, to be used by forms.
- Implemented a Location field to allow mapping weapon mounts to specific locations on a vehicle.
- Weapon Mounts can now allow specific weapons to be mounted to them in addition to the normal category restrictions. This is not currently supported through the selection window and is intended solely for use with pre-built vehicles.

- Fixed an issue with shapeshifters not getting their qualities and powers properly.
- Fixed an issue where Custom Item names would not properly display in non-English languages or get translated between languages should their names be translatable.
- When adding a new Limit Modifier, the Limit Modifier type is determined by a ComboBox selection in the Limit Modifier selection screen, rather than based on the currently selected Limit Modifier type node.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Limit Modifiers from being edited properly.
- The limit to which a Limit Modifier applies can now be changed when editing a Limit Modifier.

- Fixed an issue with armour bundles causing a crash when attempting to move items in or out of them.
- Fixed an issue where if a character's condition monitor threshold offset was greater than or equal to the regular number of condition monitor boxes they need filled per wound penalty, they would get "positive" wound modifiers applied (i.e. a dicepool bonus).
- Fixed an issue where various UI elements in the advanced lifestyle selection screen would not get translated.
- Added support for vehicle mods to get their Extra strings determined by any "select"-type bonus node, not just selecttext.
- Added the ability to target items containing the "'" character (single apostrophe) in the xpathfilter attribute of the amend system. To do so, use the "&quot;" string where you'd want to insert a quotation mark as the delimiter in the XPath filter, which should free up the "'" character (single apostrophe) to be able to be used inside the delimiter without generating errors.
- Live Custom Data now properly supports "override" and "amend" files in addition to "custom" files. Keep in mind that processing "amend" files can be especially time-consuming, so do please try to avoid using too many of them as live custom data if possible unless you're OK with Chummer5a becoming especially unresponsive.
- Added support for bonuses that query the user to select a tradition.
- When selecting a cyberware or bioware plugin, Essence cost is now only displayed as non-zero if the currently selected item would add to its parent's essence cost.

- Added the ability for any lifestyle to support bonus LP, not just Traveler, and if the user is editing a lifestyle that supports bonus LP, they can opt to manually edit the value or set it to a random 1D6 value.
- Fixed an issue where the "Quality Contributes to LP" checkbox did not function properly in the advanced lifestyle selection window.
- Shifted around some labels in the advanced lifestyle selection window so that they make more intuitive sense.
- Changed power tab list display to autoresizing table

Data Changes:

Memory storage space ("Speicherbänke") will still need be to tracked manually.

- Fixed bonus power ranks not applying properly to the Chaos, Artist, Holy Text, and Death mentor spirits. 
- Fixed Holy Text not providing a knowledge skill bonus.
- Fixed incorrect availabilities for activesofts, knowsofts, and linguasofts that were using core rulebook values instead of Chrome Flesh values.
- Fixed incorrect Essence cost for skillwires, which was using the core rulebook value of 0.1 x Rating instead of the Chrome Flesh value of 0.2 x Rating.

- Corrected a typo in the name of "Orichalcum" (it was originally called "Orichalum").

- Added an amend entry for the Federated-Boeing PBY-70 Catalina II, which has additional weapon mounts in the German version of Rigger 5. Fixes #2555

- Fixed a bug where Alchemical Focus formulae and Disenchanting Focus formulae would apply bonuses that would normally require a focus to be bound.
- Various magical supplies, formulae, foci, and reagents that previously did not query a text selection now require the user the select a tradition to which they are linked. This helps keep track of mismatched tradition penalties.
- Added amend entries to provide replacement Garage qualities. tl;dr version for why is that this allows for language files to update the new name without forcing a rename of the base quality in the language file.

- Users can now pick their default sheet to be one that is in a language different from their UI language. This also indirectly fixes issues regarding loading translations that do not have sheets attached to them.
- Fixed issues with searching for items whose names or translated names contain certain Latin diacritics with a case different from the one in the search text.

- Fixed an issue where weapon mounts could not get properly installed or uninstalled from their vehicle.

- Fixed a bug where bonus-granted echoes and metamagics would not get properly removed when the underlying bonus' source was removed.

- Fixed a crash that occured where attempting to delete something in the metamagic tree in create mode while nothing was selected.
- If a language other than en-US fails to load, Chummer5a will now default to the en-US strings when translating forms (after the appropriate error message is shown).
- Fixed an issue where multiple sources of the Prototype Transhuman bonus would override and get in the way of each other.
- Removed <transgenicsgenetechcost> from the improvement system and all code related to processing transgenics, as it is a holdover from the 4e days, and unlike something like <genetechcostmultiplier>, there is no way to translate it to 5e's mechanics.

- Fixed an issue where editing spirit or sprite notes would not mark the underlying character as "dirty". Fixes #2420.
- Fixed an issue where removing a source for prototype transhuman would not cause 'ware originally marked as prototype transhuman to revert. Fixes #2425.

- Fixed an issues caused by the equipping or unequipping armor, armor mods, gear, or cyberware completely removing linked bonuses instead of just disabling them.
- Fixed an issue where non-quality bonuses that add qualities or contacts would not properly get removed if the parent item was removed. Existing characters affected by this bug will need to Re-Apply Improvements. Fixes #2460.
- Fixed an issue where getting an error in a static constructor that would display a warning would cause Chummer5 to silently crash in the background. Fixes #2453.
- Fixed an issue where closing the character roster would continue to cause it to update in the background when a character is changed.

- Fixed an issue where the possession method selection box could never be enabled when creating a new critter.
- Changed quality adding logic so that variable karma costs are no longer supported, but adding a quality with a karma cost in career mode won't prematurely add the quality before the character confirms that they wish to buy the selected quality.
- Fixed an issue where using Reapply Improvements on a character who has less Essence than their metatype maximum could potentially increase the amount of special attribute points they would lose to Essence loss.
- Fixed an issue where karma expenditures on martial arts at chargen would not get displayed in the sidebar.
- The karma value calculator will now also display the value that should be used when comparing a priority-based character to if it were built with Point Buy (i.e. without karma value from contact points and knowledge points).
- Chummer5 will now live-update the watch folder node in the character roster if the underlying folder's contents are changed in any way.

- Added the ability for equipment of all types to have costs and availabilities based on a character's attributes.
- Fixed an issue where the house rule for attribute points getting spent after karma did nothing. Note that it will not affect attribute values when spending on special attributes with values lost from Essence loss (i.e. special attribute points will still be spent before Essence loss modifiers are applied, and karma will still be spent after Essence loss modifiers are applied), though it will still affect karma costs associated with them. Fixes #2472.

- Fixed a crash that occurred when loading old characters with too many priority points allocated to an attribute.
- Fixed an issue where limited spells would get their drain values reduced twice, once at creation and once when their drain value would be fetched. Fixes #2474.
- Fixed an issue where ammo and modes would not be translated correctly in the Browse tab of the weapon selection screen. Fixes #2481.
- Fixed an issue where buying ammo for ranged weapons and attempting to load specific ammo into bows, crossbows, and some exotic weapons would not work. Fixes #2476, fixes #2372.
- Added the ability for improvements to add weapons via the <addweapon> bonus.
- Altering custom data directory information in the options menu will now immediately apply those changes instead of requiring Chummer5a to restart (though the prompt will still appear just in case).
- Adjusted the NewSpellKarmaCost improvement to support restrictions based on spell type.
- If a custom XPath filter is specified in an amend node, the amend node will now only use that XPath filter to find its target(s) instead of using it in addition to any specified id or name node contents.
- Fixed an issue where skill group names would get cut off if they are too long.
- Added the ability for talent priority entries to specify the possibly pool of skills or skillgroups to choose from with an xpath filter.
- Fixed an issue where modifying the load order of a custom data directory after modifying whether it is enabled or not would reset any changes made to whether it was enabled or not.
- Fixed issues with copying and pasting weapons to and from vehicle mounts, gear to and from armor mods, and gear children to and from gear parents.
- Fixed an issue where Complex Form information was not properly translated.
- Fixed an issue where spells with an Extended Area would not properly display their descriptor if the "Extended" checkbox was not checked.

- Fixed a bug where armor locations could not be rearranged via drag-and-drop.

Data Changes:

- Added new items to allow for translation of certain extras, special equipment, and non-standard form factors that come with certain vehicles, weapons, and gear. Fixes #2309.
- Dodge General Trailer now properly contains an Aeronautics Mechanic Workshop (it's "Aircraft Repair" in the sourcebook, but this would not line up with the skill associated with repairing aircraft for which said workshop would be used).
- Basic Razorboi and Advanced Razorboi Packs now properly come with Cybertechnology Toolkits (it's "Cybernetics" in the sourceboo, but this would not line up with the skill associated with cybernetics for which said toolkit would be used).
- Removed the ".RF" identifier from the name of Run Faster's College Education and Inspired qualities. Removed the "(SASS)" identifier from the name of Sail Away Sweet Sister's Great Mother mentor spirit. Data that targets these items will need to rely on their id nodes.

- Fixed various typos in life module descriptions and skills.

Build 197

Application Changes:

- Fixed issues with certain selection forms not obeying restriction requirements if the search field is not empty.
- Switched the spell selection form to a style similar to most other selection forms, i.e. categories are selectable in a dropdown box and spells are located in a list view, instead of using funky tree views.
- Users can now use the Search function in the spell selection screen even if spell categories are limited to a single category.
- PACKS kits will no longer display or add items that require sourcebooks that are not enabled for the character.
- Chummer5 will no longer do spooky things if it cannot find an item tied to a particular forced value for a selection screen.
- Lifestyle dropdown boxes will now only be populated by items that abide by the character's enabled sourcebook list (so e.g. Commercial lifestyle will not show up if Run Faster is not enabled).
- When selecting critter powers for someone who can have optional critter powers, the displayed powers will now properly be filtered by the category selected in the category dropdown box.
- Fixed a crash that occured when an expense was undone or when a character file got an update outside of Chummer and the "live updates from character file" option was enabled.
- Fixed a crash when adding PACKS kits containing vehicles. Fixes #2155.
- Fixed an issue with the Notes sheet not loading under fr-FR localization.
- Fixed a bug where knowledge skill specializations bought with points under Point Buy or Life Modules would still deduct karma from the character.
- Fixed a bug where skill pool tooltips and other texts that fetch the names of bonus sources would not fetch the name of Mentor Spirits.
- Fixed a crash when attempting to fire Vehicle Weapons.
- Fixed calculation of armour to properly account for armour with override values (ie High Fashion Armour Clothing).
- Fixed a crash when attempting to add a specialization to a custom knowledge skill in career mode. Fixes #2156.
- Fixed standard weapon mounts accidentally adding their costs to their parent's total cost. 
- Added Free and Markup checkboxes to the weapon mount creator for use in Career mode.
- Completely merged the Commlink and Gear classes. Matrix stats now function independently of whether or not a gear can form a persona, and only gears that can form personas will now show up in commlink sections. This should also fix Persona Firmware not being required to allow a gear to be marked as an active commlink. Fixes #2158.
- Gear no longer adds its children's Matrix attributes to its own. Instead, separate stats are kept track of for Matrix attribute modifiers.
- Quantities of gear entries that begin with "Nuyen" will now follow the decimal formatting of nuyen cost formatting. Fixes #2157.
- The updater's install code will now attempt to handle files that are currently in use and then abort with a warning if it does not succeed instead of crashing. Fixes #2165.
- Fixed an issue with reapplying improvements for Mentor Spirits who have an "all" bonus where choices are required. Fixes #2153.
- Implemented an improvement to the selectquality method that allows having another quality provide a discount, which is used by the Wildcard Chimera quality.
- Fixed the implementation of the selectskill improvement to properly support Exotic skills. Characters with improvements such as Improved Ability (skill) should Reapply Improvements or remove and re-add the improvement source.
- Matrix Attributes are now an interface that is connected to Gear, Vehicle, and Cyberware and are able to fully interact with one another. Among other things, this means that Matrix Attributes will always show up for those items, that Electronic Modifications for Cyberware and Vehicles are possible, and that Cyberware with the Persona Firmware Electronic Modification will show up as a Commlink (and if the appropriate checkboxes are available in the UI, can be marked as an AI home node and/or the user's active commlink).
- Limit Modifier sources will now automatically display translated names when switching languages.
- Improvement source names will now also contain information about the source's parents. Fixes #2082.
- Fixed characters with Friends in High Places not being able to pass character validity checks for their Friends in High Places contacts. Fixes #2171.
- An AI can no longer adopt an item as a home node if it would not have enough program slots to hold it.
- Vehicles and cyberware can now have custom-defined Matrix attributes and/or Matrix attribute arrays in their data files.
- Added Notes fields to all Create methods for objects.
- The Translator tool can now be opened from within Chummer via Tools > Translator.
- Added a "Rebuild" button to the Translator tool. When used, it will regenerate the strings of an existing translation, removing any unused strings and adding any new ones that have been added after the document was initially created.
- Fixed a crash when refunding vehicle purchases in career mode. Fixes #2184.
- Fixed weapons on weapon mounts not being calculated into sell and refund amounts.
- Fixed behaviour of ArmorRating property to properly account for the Custom Fit (Stack) rules from Run and Gun again.
- Fixed a bug where the quality level numerical up-down would never be enabled in Career mode.
- Fixed a bug where Re-Apply Improvements would not properly re-apply bonuses of 'ware, first level bonuses of qualities, and bonuses tied to items that were included in a filter list but whose parents were not included.
- If the updater encounters an error during installation of the new update, it will now restore the old versions of all files. Fixes #2175.
- Added support for translation of items in ranges.xml and spiritpowers.xml. Updated the translator to also process data from these files.
- Fixed various issues regarding encumbrance, Custom Fit, clothing, and items that add armor value. Fixes #2188.
- Made some minor tweaks to lifestyles. Fixes a quirk if a character gains Improvements that change their lifestyle costs, cost alterations from lifestyle qualities are shown in their treenode. 
- Fixed incorrect Concealment values for Bio-Spike II and III.
- Multiple languages can be translated at the same time using Translator, and it now supports cancellation of Create and Rebuild operations.
- Altered the format of entries in ranges.xml so that they conform to a similar format as other data types (their names are now stored in "name" nodes instead of "category" nodes). This also fixes issues with the Translator incorrectly loading and saving range entries.
- The amend system for custom data now supports the use of custom XPath filters. This means that a single amending node can now modify multiple nodes based on whatever XPath filters are defined in its xpathfilter attribute. The "Cyberlimbs Cannot Add Headware" custom ruleset in the customdata folder has been updated to use this system, and it now also serves as an example for how to use custom XPath filters for amends.
- Tabs can now be scrolled through with the mousewheel.
- Ghetto workaround to allow exotic ranged weapons to buy their own ammunition again in career mode. Super fragile, may break at the drop of a hat.
- Added "Active Commlink" and "Home Node" checkboxes to the Cyberware tab, and added an "Active Commlink" checkbox to the Vehicles tab.
- Fixed a bug where player names would not show up in the character roster. Fixes #2195.
- Weapons on vehicles/drones that use STR, Physical Limit, and/or AGI for their stats will now properly use attributes based on that vehicle/drone.
- Fixed issues regarding undoing expenses involving weapon mounts, armor, and/or armor mods.
- Fixed issues with refunding lifestyle expenses if a character has two or more lifestyles of the same type/level.
- Added support to use attributes and XPath expressions in a weapon's AP field.
- Added a label in Create mode that becomes visible when a character has Prototype Transhuman. This label tracks the current amount of essence used up by 'ware marked as Prototype Transhuman. Fixes #1764.
- Fixed being able to mark 'ware children as Prototype Transhuman independently from the main 'ware itself.
- Fixed being able to mark Cyberware as Prototype Transhuman.
- Fixed Essence usage displays in the 'ware tab not properly reflecting the setting for Essence decimals to which to round.
- Fixed a bug where player names would not show up in the character roster.
- Cyberware, Gear, Armor and Armor Mod Ratings are now properly bound by their Min and Max Ratings. May cause issues in career mode if you suddenly become Aged with cyberware or something, but eh. Baby steps.
- Fixed a crash when adding multiple armor mods a given piece of armor in career mode.
- Fixed a potential crash when loading lifestyles that didn't have their base lifestyle saved properly.
- Added preliminary support for being able to switch languages without restarting Chummer. This also feeds into character sheets that would be printed in a language different from the one under which Chummer is running. Note that not all strings properly update yet.
- Added a basic system for management of vehicle-based firing modes. 
- Implemented support for vehicle mods altering the ammo capacity of a given weapon mount's weapon(s). 
- Added support for editing weapon mounts in create mode, career mode edits will come when I sort out how to manage the Expenses properly. 
- Fixed behaviour of the selectpowers improvement not working properly for powers that depend on having a Rating.
- Various build methods can now ban specific grades of 'ware instead of relying on a blanket ban of Betaware, Deltaware and Gammaware at character creation. Custom and override gameplayoptions.xml files will need to be updated manually to accommodate this change.
- Banned grades are now not shown while in create mode. Optional rules to override this behaviour if the character has Restricted Gear or under other specific circumstances will come in a later build as part of #1089.
- Fixed a bug where selected category and selected grade were not saved in the cyberware and bioware selection screens.
- Fixed a bug where the Translator tool was saving page numbers in an incorrectly named node. Existing translations will automatically get their page number nodes renamed if they are rebuilt.
- Fixed an issue with the Translator tool incorrectly saving gameplay options as part of the entries for the priorities file.
- Fixed alternate page references never showing up for translated skills.
- Fixed a bug where the Translator tool would not properly consider and treat alternate codes for books.
- Added a small shim to the skill loader that prevents an error if the character somehow gains two copies of the same skill.
- Removed the nomission property, as this is now managed by customdata.
- Fixed a bug where the optional rule for having positive quality costs double if over the limit would not get enabled/disabled properly.
- Added the ability to have echoes as part of "forbidden" and "required" nodes.
- Removed a readonly flag that prevented using the selectparagon bonus.
- Fixed the selectspell improvement to properly add the relevant spell to the character. 
- Tweaked the list of Spells to be an observable collection to allow updating the UI whenever the spell list changes.
- Added support to the Amend system to be able to use operations other than the default ones. The four currently supported operations are "recurse" (perform amending recursively on children), "replace" (completely replace the target node's InnerXml), "append" (add to the target node's InnerXml), and "remove" (remove the target node). If no operation is specified, "recurse" is the default if the target node(s) have children and "replace" is the default if they do not. The 'remove="yes"' system for marking nodes for removal has been replaced by 'amendoperation="remove"'.
- Fixed a bug where strings related to contacts were not properly translated.
- Fixed a bug where certain changes to maximum MAG and/or maximum RES would not properly change the maximum Force/Level values for spirits and sprites tied to the character.
- Fixed a bug where canceling out of the karma spending prompt to fetter a spirit would still cause the spirit to be fettered.
- Fixed translation system for certain strings in the Relationships tab, metatypes in the character roster, labels in the weapon mount creation screen, and other, miscellaneous strings. Fixes #2238.
- Fixed issues with printing nested gear and nested cyberware in the Shadowrun 5 character sheet set.
- Fixed an issue with the Vehicles character sheet set trying to fetch "Parachuting" instead of "Free-Fall" for skills relevant to aerial vehicles.
- Updated the livingpersona improvement so that it uses SR5e values instead of SR4e ones. Fixes #2239.
- Added improvements for adding complex forms through bonus nodes via selectcomplexform and addcomplexform, which function almost identically to their spell counterparts. Fixes #2242.
- Added a checkbox to disable or enable the filter for banned grades of 'ware in create mode. When selecting the cyberware, you will not be permitted to add the item if the grade is in the banned list.
- Altered requirements checker to test for submersion grade and echo limitations.
- Fixed a crash when attempting to create spells.
- Fixed spells in create mode not working properly with Limited, Extended and Alchemical settings.
- Fixed an issue with WeaponCategoryDV improvements such as Critical Strike not properly applying to Unarmed Combat-linked weapons.
- Fixed an issue in which items with no accessory mounts would cause a generation issue when using non-English strings.
- Fixed an issue with the XML amendment system that prevented new nodes from being added to the parent object. The main affected entry for this involves Adapsin; characters using this bioware should Reapply Improvements.
- Fixed an issue with the id node checker that prevented it from properly checking items with ids that were not specifically grandparents of the root chummer node in an xml file (e.g. Metavariants, Life Modules).
- Fixed issues with the karma value calculator when calculating the karma value of MAG and the karma value of attributes on shapeshifters.
- Fixed a bug where only the first specialization was indented in the Shadowrun 5 character sheet set. Fixes #2253.
- Added a dropdown menu option to bulk-add contacts, enemies and pets from a given XML file. To use this, create an XML file that contains valid contacts from an existing Chummer file, or alter this template: https://pastebin.com/W9q8jEnt Note that this system is designed to import ALL valid contacts in the file, irrespective of whether you click on Contacts or Enemies.
- Fixed a bug where requirement nodes reliant on having a certain number of spells from a category would not get processed correctly.
- Implemented a house rule to control whether the karma gained from enemies counts against your Negative Quality limit in create mode.
- The Translator will now process paragons, vessels, and mods for vehicle weapon mounts.
- Fixed issues regarding the translation, deletion, and selling of mods to vehicle weapon mounts and weapons added to mods of vehicle weapon mounts.
- Fixed issues loading characters made with gameplay options that are not present in the current dataset.
- Fixed a typo where the character validity checker would display unspent skill group points as unspent special attribute points.
- Metatype, attributes, and special attributes priority categories now also support gameplayoptions-specific choices.
- Fixed a crash when loading characters in career mode that have access to the Spells and Spirits tab, but don't have a Tradition.
- Metatypes for pets/cohorts are now alterable as a combobox if there is no character linked to a given pet/cohort. The suggested values loaded for the combobox are populated based on content in critters.xml. Fixes #2269.
- Added a menu option in Create mode to change your existing Options file choice. It is still strongly recommended that you create your custom options file before making any characters in order to ensure that all options are adhered to correctly, but in most cases anything weird will get caught by the next save/load.
- Fixed an issue where characters' trust fund-enabled lifestyles would be kept free after they lose their trust found source.
- Fixed a bug where characters with Ex-Con could still buy (non-modular) Restricted and/or Forbidden 'ware. Getting Ex-Con in Create mode will now remove all ineligible 'ware from the character, and getting Ex-Con in Career mode will do the same for all 'ware that does not have a "None" grade (so e.g. genemods are kept).
- Fixed a bug where characters with Erased did not have their Public Awareness capped to 1.
- Fixed a bug where losing the Overclocker quality would not remove the overclocked benefit from affected gear.
- Fixed a crash in the Translator when a user attempts to search for an item while having no cell selected.
- Fixed an issue where Redliner would not trigger off of modular full cyberlimbs. Fixes #2275.
- Implemented a proof-of-concept system for extracting text from the sourcebook for a given object. Currently only works with qualities that are being created, because string manipulation with unreliable formats is annoying. If you can think of a reliable way to parse paragraphs out of a plaintext block, feel free to let me know.
- Fixed an issue where knowledge hardwires would not let the user choose a knowledge skill.
- Added an invite link to the Chummer Discord to the help menu toolstrip.
- Fixed an issue with loading the Black Market Discount property. Existing characters will need to reapply improvements to fix it. 
- Fully implemented the automatic system for Black Market Pipeline to apply to all valid object types (Armor, Armor Mod, Bio/Cyberware, Gear, Vehicles, Vehicle Mods, Weapons). Weapon Accessories don't use the category system that this binds to, so another solution will need to be found for them. I'm unsure what to bind most of the Gear categories to, so I've just been rather generous with Drugs and Electronics for now. 
- Fixed a crash when selecting a character with a 'None' metavariant in the roster. Shouldn't happen, but just in case.
- Fixed an issue where the Life Modules root node would not get translated.
- Added a warning prompt about Life Modules not being fully supported when enabling the relevant option.
- Fixed an issue where clicking on a cell under the "Browse" tab in the armor selection screen would result in that armor getting added to the character. Fixes #2303.
- Fixed a bug where restoring essence to a character would also restore lost special attribute values.
- Chummer5a will now use the number localization of the currently loaded language (if possible) instead of that of the user's system.
- Added the option to remove a quantity of gear other than 1 in Career mode.
- Added a Matrix Condition Monitor to the Weapons tab.

Data Changes:

- Fixed Virtual Machine so that it can hold 2 cyberprograms (for when proper support for cyberprogram handling is added).
- Data lock cyberware will now display its proper Matrix attributes, i.e. with a Device Rating equal to its rating instead of being based off of its grade.
- Implemented priority mode requirements for shapeshifters. 
- Added a missing bonus to The Magician's Way quality that prevented it from granting discounted powers.
- Corrected the code of the Japanese localization to ja-JP (from jp-JP).
- Fixed Berserker's Rage being eligible for a PP discount under The Spiritual Way. Part of #2180.
- Fixed a crash caused by a typo in Thundercloud Morgan's weapon mounts. Fixes #2183.
- Fixed being able to change the spirit category of Summoning, Binding, and Banishing foci.
- The Spiritual Way now allows discounting the following powers that were previously missed: Heightened Concentration, Spirit Ram, Nimble Fingers, Metabolic Control, Magic Sense, Kinesics Mastery, Traceless Walk, Pain Resistance, Improved Physical Attribute.
- The Ultimax Carbine has been converted back to using its actual stats from Gun H(e)aven 3, as no official errata has ever been released for it. An amend entry has been added to the SR Missions 1.4 Rules customdata folder, and a separate entry has been added for users that want to treat Missions as official errata for it. Characters that already have this weapon should not be affected, but I'd recommend enabling the rule if you intend to reapply improvements or purchase a new one at some point.
- Fixed Karma values for qualities from Dark Terrors.
- Fixed being unable to buy Flex Hand if the user had bought any cyberarms. Fixes #2202.
- Removed extra recoil compensation from the Walther P118.
- Old weapon mount mods have been flagged as hidden.
- Added missing improvement to the Burnout's Way quality that allowed the replacement Grade to show up properly. Existing characters will need to remove and re-add the quality or use the Reapply Improvements menu.
- Added default banned grades to the default gameplayoptions.xml entries. 
- Fixed incorrect categories for the Claw and Barrage spells.
- Implemented the Gyro-Stabilization vehicle mod as a customdata entry per the entry in the German version of Rigger 5.0. This file will be merged into the main file if the mod ever gets erratad into the English version.
- Fixed a bug where the incorrect message was displayed if someone exceeded their maximum amount of negative metagenetic qualities. Fixes #2225.
- Fixed a bug where loading a character in create mode who had more priority points spent in an attribute than their attribute maximum would cause Chummer to crash. Fixes #2222.
- Fixed incorrect page reference for Rockblood Signature Armored Shirt. Fixes #2233.
- Implemented the Hedge Witch and Elementalist Focused Awakened as qualities. 
- Implemented the bonus for the Structured Spellcasting metamagic.
- Fixed a duplicate id in the Pomorya Nationality Life Module.
- Fixed incorrect category for Ford Titan. Fixes #2262.
- Fixed an issue where characters could take the Trust Fund quality multiple times.
- Fixed an issue where players could add audio and vision enhancement gear to cyberears and cybereyes respectively (they should be restricted to 'ware plugins only), but could not add sensors or custom gear item plugins. Existing characters with cyberears and cybereyes will need to re-add the affected 'ware in order to benefit from this fix.
- Added missing id nodes to vessels in vessels.xml.
- Fixed an issue where characters were limited to only one active hardwire and one knowledge hardwire. Fixes #2289.
- Fixed the Growth spell having "Special" as its drain code instead of F+3.
- Added an amend entry to convert the Growth spell to the version used by the German version of Forbidden Arcana.
- Corrected "The Seattle Gauntlet" to "The Seattle Gambit".

Application Changes:

- Fixed display of nuyen karma cost in the karma cost summary to not switch to the actual nuyen value. 
- Fixed quirks with attribute point warnings when moving to career mode. 
- Fixed an issue when loading critters that caused them to have lower attribute values than intended.
- Added backend support for wireless bonuses to Gear, Armor, Armor Mods, Vehicle Mods, and Cyberware.
- Fixed an issue where lifestyle qualities would not have closing square brackets for their costs.
- Altered the Limit Spirit Selection bonus so that it also adds to its selection to the bonus' source. This also makes Apprentice indicate the both the chosen spirit type and the chosen spell category.
- Fixed an issue that allowed priority choices that received a single skill or skill group to receive multiples.
- Fixed incorrect costs for binding foci when using non-English language files.
- Fixed an issue with free spells from Dedicated Spellslinger improperly prompting for Karma in career mode.
- Fixed archaic handling of how restrictions are applied to bonus Adept powers by adding a "bonus override" portion to bonuses that add specific Adept powers with certain restrictions (e.g. specifically free levels in Attribute Boost AGI instead of in any Attribute Boost).
- Fixed a bug where bonuses granting free levels of certain adept powers, e.g. Improved Ability, would not actually have their effect applied, and would also not have their effect properly removed if the source of the bonus was removed.
- Made minor performance optimization to code that constructs the dicepool tooltips for skills.
- The "Select Skill" form can now process multiple skill group inclusions, skill group exclusions, and skill category inclusions the same way it does for multiple skill inclusions (the old way of handling multiple skill category inclusions still works). It can also handle multiple filters at once, e.g. list only Physical Skills that are linked to STR, or list all Social Skills excluding the ones in the Acting skill group.
- Fixed a bug that prevented bonuses granting free levels of certain powers from updating values boosted by said powers. Fixes #1834 and #1856.
- Fixed a bug that made removing items that granted free levels of adept powers sometimes not actually remove the improvements added by said adept powers.
- Fixed a bug that allowed the deletion of some powers without levels that were granted by free levels of adept powers.
- Maximum values for adept powers should now update properly with changes to MAG values, and in the case of Improved Ability, changes to skill ratings.
- Cancelling out of a dialog triggered by selecting an adept power or a property of an adept power will now properly cancel the dialog and not actually add the last/default selected choice.
- Added support for skill selection dialogs to be able to only show skills for which the runner has a rating greater than or equal to a pre-defined rating and/or less than or equal to a pre-defined rating. In case there are no eligible options, a warning dialog is displayed, and the skill selection dialog is automatically treated as cancelled.
- Added support for bonuses to defense dice (e.g. Combat Sense, Reakt).
- Added support for Barehanded Adept and qualities similar to it.
- Drain for Physical Adepts is now properly displayed and calculated as BOD + WIL.
- Reapply Improvements will now start by clearing out all improvements that it would reapply, regardless of source names. This helps clean out old .chum5 saves that have orphaned improvements, which fixes #1916.
- Chummer5 will now warn users when it does not have the proper write permissions to its own folder, or if an error was encountered that prevented a character from being saved. Fixes #1915.
- The "Buy Specialization with Karma" checkbox is now also automatically checked if buying a specialization for a skill that was ranked up with skill group points.
- Added support for qualities that can be purchased with spell points instead of karma at chargen.
- Added support for essence penalty improvements that only affect MAG, as well as essence penalty improvements that have hundredths-level precision instead of integer precision.
- Fixed a bug where the optional rule that allows Mystic Adept PPs to be bought with priority spell points also allowed purchasing of PPs with free spell points given by Dedicated Spellslinger.
- Requirements that check for whether MAG, RES, or DEP are >= 1 will now instead check for if the corresponding attribute is enabled.
- When adding adept powers, the list of available adept powers will hide powers whose prerequisites are not met.
- Added support for any attribute or special attribute to be used in a weapon's damage code.
- Fixed Character Validity Checker not properly counting attribute points and special attribute points. Fixes #1917.
- Fixed Character Validity Checker not counting vehicle mod slot modifiers when checking vehicle mods are over capacity. Fixes #1875.
- Fixed attribute points, special attribute points, and displayed metatype limits not updating if/when metatype limits are changed. Fixes #1912.
- Added support for the following requirements (to qualities): the item can only be taken during character generation, the item cannot be bought separately in priority-based character generation methods.
- Added support for qualities that refund their cost when removed in career mode. The fact that such a quality can be bought for its normal price in chargen and then refunded for double its price in career mode is working as intended, as per rules for swapping Latent Dracomorphosis for a Drake quality.
- "Don't Show Metagenetic Qualities" is automatically checked when choosing qualities for characters without any SURGE quality.
- Added support for setting a different quality (and other item) count limit when the quality would be taken at chargen.
- Added support for including other quality names when checking against the quality count limit. Also added support to set the total limit when including differently named qualities to something different from the main limit for the quality itself (e.g. Tough as Nails has an individual limit of 3 per Condition Monitor type, but the total limit of Physical + Stun versions of Tough as Nails is 4).
- Set the default quality count limit to 1 instead of Unlimited.
- Added support for bonuses that disable dicepool bonuses from specializations for a selected or specific skill
- Fixed a bug where Dealer Connection could be taken multiple times for the same category.
- Fixed a bug where the categories in Dealer Connection could not be localized.
- Qualities added by improvements (e.g. Poor Self Control Thrill Seeker for Daredrenaline) can no longer be deleted unless the source of the improvement is removed. The source of the improvement will also be printed with the quality on character sheets.
- Multiple instances of the same quality will get combined into one entry. For example, 3 entries for "Social Appearance Anxiety" will get combined into "Social Appearance Anxiety 3". Qualities from different source types will not stack in this way. 
- Fixed a bug where qualities to be added from an improvement would not be added if an instance of the quality already exists. This should e.g. allow Daredrenaline to properly represent its effects if the runner already has Poor Self Control Thrill Seeker.
- Also added a numerical up-down control to quickly add or remove multiple instances of the same quality.
- Added support for a quality to only apply certain bonuses at its first level.
- Fixed a bug where newly added items would not cancel themselves if a quality that their bonus added could not be taken for the character.
- Adept powers without and Adept way discount specified can no longer cause crashes.
- Magician's Way now works via blacklist instead of whitelist: all powers that have Adept way discounts and that are not specified that Magician's Way is forbidden from getting them discounted will always be eligible for a Magician's Way discount. Fixes #1926.
- Fixed a bug where the Spells & Spirits tab would not appear for Adepts who would want to or have already learned Rituals or spells through Barehanded Adept. Fixes #1933.
- Added support to display alternate ranges for weapons in addition to their main ranges. Fixes #1807.
- Altered Create mode and Career mode windows to have identical dimensions and identical splits. Altered Weapon and Vehicle tabs in Create and Career mode both to largely match each other's layout and make room for alternate ranges.
- Fixed a possible crash if a Resonance talent priority was defined with no free Complex Forms.
- Fixed wonky behavior if skill value and a skill group value items were added to a talent priority. Now, skill value always takes complete precedence over skill group value.
- Added support for talent priorities that give bonus special attribute points.
- Fixed an issue where having multiple mugshots could cause the main mugshot to get overwritten when creating a character sheet.
- Added proper support for mugshots of any arbitrary size to be properly displayed. Removed Label_MugshotDimensions and its related label because it is now redundant. Due to wonkiness with how Internet Explorer handles resizing images, it is still recommended that you save to HTML first and then print your sheet from within a browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Also, larger mugshots considerably increase the size of savefiles, so be reasonable.
- Added support for improvements that add bonus dice to a particular weapon category.
- Fixed the updater and "Restart Application" not working properly if Chummer5's exe was renamed.
- Made a minor refactor of the ImprovementManager. On the user side, fetching of improvement-boosted values should be significantly faster.
- When values of improvements are fetched, precedence0 and precedence1 items will now check the total value of items without precedence, and if they are less than the latter, they will not override it. Fixes #1231.
- Added support for the inclusion of adept powers and critter powers in requirements lists.
- Added support for CM threshold offset improvements that are shared between Physical and Stun tracks. Note that these are always cumulative with regular CM threshold improvements.
- The category of all knowledge skills are now saved with the character. Fixes #1670, fixes #1624.
- Fixed a bug where knowledge skill purchased in Create mode could have their category changed in Career mode if they were not advanced with karma. Fixes #1773.
- Fixed notes in Skills and Calendar not obeying the Print Notes option.
- Fixed Fancy Blocks character sheet so that its blocks no longer cut across pages and its page break options work properly. Fixes #1018.
- All items, including sourcebooks, will now always obey the <hide /> element and never show up in any browsing or selection lists if they are tagged as such. In the case of enabled sourcebooks, they become disabled when hidden.
- Fixed a bug where Select Skill Specialization, Select Skill, Select Exotic Skill, Select Cyberware Suite, and Select Critter Power did not obey rules for what sourcebooks were enabled.
- The message that warns of missing sourcebooks when a character is loaded is now localizable.
- Added the ability to amend items instead of completely overriding them. When amending items, only nodes that are present in the amended node will overwrite or add to older data. Tags can also be removed this way by adding the 'remove="yes"' attribute to an element in an amending node. An ID and/or a Name field must be specified for all items regardless, as that is how the system identifies what data to amend. Sub-elements with children that also have ID and/or Name fields (e.g. metavariants lists inside metatype entries) will be treated the same way as their parents, i.e. only nodes present in the amending file will be overwritten, added, or removed.
- Added the ability to load and set any custom data directory as a custom ruleset. Once added, these data directories will be saved to a list and can be toggled the same way as sourcebooks. Entries with invalid directory paths will be removed on startup, and if someone is running Chummer for the first time or has only invalid directory paths, Chummer will automatically populate the custom data directory list with each folder it finds in the "customdata" folder (they all start disabled).
- Fixed detection of Burnout's Way when combined with Adapsin.
- Added an option in the Select Gear dialog to only show items that the character can currently afford.
- Select Armor, Select Cyberware, Select Bioware, Select Gear, Select Vehicle, and Select Weapon screens now all have a category that shows all items, and searching for items on those screens will now only search within the selected category. In the case of Select Cyberware and Select Bioware screens, the current selection will be saved when switching between grades and selecting a particular grade will automatically hide all items that cannot be taken in that grade. Selecting the Cultured Bioware category when the Used grade is selected will switch the selected grade back to Standard.
- An Optional Rule has been provided (Search In Category Only) that will disable the whitelisting based on category, which is enabled by default. It can be disabled in General Options under Miscellaneous. 
- The Select Cyberware screen will now only display Cyberlimb Customizations and Cyberlimb Enhancements when adding a subsystem to a cyberlimb.
- Fixed a bug where cost modifiers were not properly applied to gear with FixedValue costs.
- Removed references to <cost3>, <cost6>, <cost10>, <avail3>, <avail6>, and <avail10> nodes, as they are obsolete. Added a legacy shim to handle these entry types from savefiles and convert them to just using <cost> and <avail> respectively.
- Added support for bonuses that remove the ability to add cyberware, remove the ability to add bioware, or modify the essence cost of bioware or cyberware in a way that stacks multiplicatively with other modifiers instead of additively.
- Added a houserule option to allow skill points to be used to buy specializations for karma-bought skills.
- Added support for mixing of special cost and availability expressions. For example, one can now mix "FixedValues()" with "Parent Cost" and Chummer5 should know how to handle it. 
- Added support for using expressions to define Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, Firewall, and Device Rating.
- Altered commlink system and related UI so that gear with the attributesarray tag is treated as being able to swap its Matrix attributes, while those without it cannot.
- Altered commlink system so that any gear with a devicerating tag is marked and treated as a commlink, rather than it being hardcoded to a few, specific categories.
- Added support for gear that modifies Matrix attributes, both in terms of modifying a cyberdeck array and in terms of modifying a specific Matrix attribute. Commlinks and cyberdecks modify their Matrix attributes by their children's stats.
- Added support for essence cost modifiers (additively stacking multipliers) and total essence cost modifiers (multiplicatively stacking multipliers) that do not retroactively alter existing cyberware's essence costs.
- Added support for cyberware to come with built-in gear.
- Vehicles, weapons, armor mods, weapon accessories, and cyberware that are added by gear and/or cyberware or are included in their parents are now all colored gray when without notes and can no longer be removed without removing their parents. The Unarmed Attack entry in the weapons list can never be removed and is always colored gray if there are no notes attached.
- Added support for gear that modifies its parent's Matrix condition monitor.
- If an item has a higher rating than the number of entries in an attribute it has that uses a FixedValue() system, then Chummer5 will select the last item instead of crashing.
- Standardized the code to retrieve an item's XML entry. As a side effect, some translation issues have been fixed.
- Added support for the usegears sections of gear entries to start with their node collapsed, added support to define new source and page entries to usegear entries, and added support to make each usegear entry to not create the item's default children and/or not apply the item's improvements. Gear that is marked as "do not apply improvements" when created will also not have its children create improvements.
- When a Custom Item entry is added as a default child of another item, it will no longer prompt the user to enter a price (it will always be 0), and if the select attribute in the entry's name tag is set, then that value will be the Custom Item's name as well.
- Added support for gear that lets users choose between a selection of default children, via the <choosegear></choosegear> attributes. Each set of those tags inside of <gears></gears> is one choice that the user can make, and the user must choose between one of the <usegear></usegear> entries within each <choosegear></choosegear>.
- Added support to tag gear as requiring a parent to be added, i.e. to mark the gear as an enhancement or plugin item.
- Increased the size of the Rating box in SelectGear to accommodate larger ratings e.g. that credsticks might have.
- Fixed a bug where selecting the "All" category in the form to select vehicle mods did not adhere to the category limit selection if one was set.
- Fixed the "Hide Items Over Avail Limit" option on the vehicle mods selection screen so that it actually hides mods that are over the availability limit when checked.
- Fixed a bug where having a positive essence score of less than 0.01 (in case the number of essence decimal places is set to 3 or greater) would mark the character as invalid for career mode. Fixes #1951.
- Removed the piece of code that selected all text in Translator's search box whenever focus was gained to it. Fixes #1945.
- Added Bubble Die option to dice roller that fixes glitch chances on even-numbered dicepools. When rolling an even-numbered dicepool with it enabled, an extra, "bubble" die is rolled for the purposes of determining whether the test glitches or not. This causes glitch chances for even-numbered pools are no longer be ridiculously low: pools of 0 have the same glitch chances as pools of 1, pools of 2 have the same glitch chances as pools of 3, so on.
- Corrected the code that calculates weapon dicepool for drones in Career mode. Also added identical functionality to Create mode.
- Corrected a bug where re-rolling failures in the dice roller would ignore the "rush job" checkbox.
- Corrected a bug where the dice roller determined glitches to occur when at least half of the dicepool are 1s (RAW requires more than half of the dicepool to be 1s).
- Upgraded the random number generator used for dice rolling from a Linear Congruential RNG to a Mersenne Twister RNG. This should drastically reduce the "patterns" one might see in random results, as those "patterns" come about as a result of the very low quality of randomness of Linear Congruential RNGs.
- Fixed a bug where adding an item (e.g. a quality or adept power) that grants critter powers will not cause those critter powers to be removed should the item be removed. Fixes #1953.
- Fixed a bug that caused bonuses that increased a skill's rating to act the same way as bonuses to the skill's dicepool, e.g. karma costs would not increase and specializations could not be taken if the skill had no points or karma allocated to increasing its rating. Fixes #1743.
- Fixed a bug that prevented knowledge skills from having their names translated when printed out to a character sheet. Fixes #1668.
- Added set of improvements that can disable access to specific grades of bioware and cyberware. These limits are bypassed for all 'ware that forces a particular grade, so any restrictions in those cases need to be applied to the specific piece of 'ware in question.
- Fixed the "Hide Items Over Avail Limit" checkbox so that it displays the availability limit of the character in parentheses instead of the default availability value.
- Added the ability for pre-installed subsystems in cyberare to include bioware and pre-installed subsystems in bioware to include cyberware. Added the ability for pre-installed cyberware and bioware subsystems to come with their own pre-installed gear and pre-installed subsystems.
- Restrictions via the <forbidden> and <required> tags for bioware and cyberware will now also check subsystems, not just top-level cyberware and bioware.
- Fixed names for improvement sources originating from nested cyberware, bioware, and gear not showing up properly.
- Fixed bonuses for nested 'ware not getting removed when the parent is removed if the given piece of 'ware is a grandchild or later descendant of the 'ware getting removed.
- Fixed a bug that caused 'ware grades to not obey the enabled sourcebook rules, e.g. Omegaware would show up even if Chrome Flesh was not enabled.
- Fixed a bug where the Power selection dialog allowed the user to select a power that was marked as hidden or was from a sourcebook that the user did not have enabled.
- Unhardcoded Cultured bioware's restriction from Used grade. Now any piece of bioware or cyberware can be marked as being ineligible for Used grade.
- If Chummer5 encounters an error while loading improvements from a savefile, it will now continue loading the character instead of crashing, and it will prompt the user to re-apply the problematic improvements when the character is loaded.
- Added a new item in the Special options menu that calculates the total karma value of a character during character creation.
- Fixed a prompt for modications to items when browsing the Select Armor window.
- Fixed an incorrect Karma cost change when using the Improved Ability (skill) power in create mode. 
- Fixed display of karma costs for skills in create mode to not show Karma twice.
- Fixed the Updater crashing when a .pdb file or .exe file is in use. Also made the updater display a permissions warning if it cannot rename or remove old files instead of having it crash.
- Fixed Home Node-based stat calculation issues for AIs. The presence of a home node and any stats calculated from it will now be handled correctly. Fixes #1963.
- Added support for up to 3 free skills to be selected from priorities. If more than 3 skills are defined in a priority entry, Chummer5 will now display the first 3 instead of displaying none. Fixes #1964.
- Fixed a crash when using Re-apply Improvements while having qualities that add other qualities.
- Adding multiple instances of overlapping SpecialSkills improvements will no longer duplicate skills, and removing a SpecialSkills improvement will no longer remove skills if another SpecialSkills improvement still exists that would enable the same skills. Fixes #1513.
- Fixed the Improvements manager not properly detecting some cases of cancelled dialogs. Fixes #1830.
- Fixed a null reference stack overflow if launching Chummer for the first time without a Sourcebook key in the registry. 
- Fixed a null reference when selecting weapons with built-in gear.
- Fixed a bug where trying to change the quantity of a gear plugin in Create mode would not work.
- Added support for costs, gear quantities, and gear capacities that are not integers. All nuyen costs should now be tracked to decimal precision (precision depends on how large the number is), though Chummer5 will only display up to 2 decimal places.
- Updated the tool that saves character sheets to PDF so that it shouldn't mess up sheet formatting as much as the previous one.
- Slightly altered the UI for the quality selection window so that it is clearer what the numerical up-downs in it represent. Fixes #1971.
- Fixed a bug that caused the dicepool for resisting physical illusion spells to be calculated as WIL + WIL and displayed as INT + WIL instead of the LOG + INT that it should be.
- Added support for tracking of fatigue resistance, dicepools for addiction tests (physiological, psychological, both in the "not yet addicted" and "already addicted" variety), resistance and/or immunity to toxins (in all four vectors), resistance and/or immunity to pathogens (in all four vectors), natural physical CM recovery, and natural stun CM recovery. All of these stats are now printed with the Print() method, so character sheets can integrate them into their displays.
- Added support for the following bonuses: extra fatigue resistance dice, extra dice for addiction (physiological, psychological, both in the "not yet addicted" and "already addicted" variety), extra resistance and/or immunity to toxins (in all four vectors), extra resistance and/or immunity to pathogens (in all four vectors), extra natural physical CM recovery, extra natural stun CM recovery, the toggling of adding Essence as bonus dice to natural physical and/or stun CM recovery, bonus dice to resist mental and/or physical manipulation spells, bonus dice to resist mana and/or physical illusion spells, bonus dice to resist detection spells, bonus armor against fire damage, bonus armor against cold damage, bonus armor against electricity damage, bonus armor against acid damage, bonus armor against falling damage, extra radiation resistance dice, extra sonic attack resistance dice, extra dice specifically to resist Judge Intentions, and extra dice specifically for initiating Judge Intentions tests. All existing items that should contain one or more of these bonuses have also been updated.
- Items that are set to require a certain amount of 'ware grade in essence now properly works with Burnout's Way and Adapsin.
- Fixed a bug where the initiative roller would calculate initiative with a flat probability distribution instead of with one mirroring the rolling of multiple dice (i.e. binomial-esque).
- Dice Roller will now display the sum of the dice results (disregarding bubble dice) under the information about whether the roll was a success, a failure, a glitch, and/or a critical glitch.
- Fixed a bug where bioware subsystems would always add to their parent's essence. This is now instead controlled by a separate tag instead of reliant on 'ware type.
- Fixed a bug where cyberware and bioware that cost 0 essence but take up capacity when added to a cyberlimb (e.g. cortex bombs) would not show up in the list of standalone 'ware to add.
- Fixed Detection spell defense being shown as INT + REA instead of LOG + WIL.

- Made the reference in for Life Module Selection clickable.

- Fixed a bug where removing improvements that gave martial arts, spells, qualities, or critter powers would not remove improvements associated with the given item.
- Fixed a bug where Chummer5 would calculate incorrect movement speed values from cyberlegs if the option was enabled but only one cyberleg was present.
- Added backend support for cyberware bonuses that only activate per pair instead of per discrete piece.
- Fixed a bug where cyberware added to vehicles did not allow for subsystems to be added to it.
- Fixed issues with skill dicepool tooltips not properly recognizing improvement sources from cyberware, nested 'ware, armor, armor mods, martial arts advantages, critter powers, and nested gear (including ones inside weapons, armor, armor mods, weapon accessories, cyberware, and vehicles).
- Movement speeds should now properly display decimal values (e.g. "4/8, 1.5m/hit") when applicable.
- Fixed a crash when adding an item with over 1,000 capacity in a culture using a decimal comma. Fixes #1983.
- Allowed for full localization of the updater, added a label to indicate whether the user is running the latest version of Chummer5 that is available on their chosen update channel (stable or nightly), and force-disabled the Download button if they are running what is the latest version of their chosen update channel (the button isn't disabled if they're running the latest nightly, but switched update channels to stable). Fixes #1977.
- Fixed being unable to select underbarrel weapons for SelectWeapon bonuses (e.g. picking a weapon for Spare Clips).
- Fixed an issue with items that use the SelectWeapon improvement type passing an internal ID rather than the Name of the weapon.
- Crash Dumper will no longer crash when it cannot connect to an upload service, and it will prompt the user to manually submit an issue to GitHub with the attached minidump.
- Transformed the GlobalOptions, LanguageManager, and XmlManager classes into fully static classes. For users, this also produces a measurable performance increase and a decrease in the size of Chummer5's executable.
- Fixed a bug related to selecting the default, blank entry in the Traditions dropdown combobox and then trying to add a spell.
- Allowed Edge to be burned to zero. Fixes #1989.
- Allowed filtering for skills that use any attribute, in case custom data adds any that are linked to DEP or ESS.
- Swimming should no longer show up as a skill to characters who cannot swim or have special Swimming rules, and Running should not show up as a skill to characters who cannot move on land or have special rules for land movement.
- Fixed a bug where the option that enables education qualities' karma discount at chargen causes every second level to be free instead of decreasing the karma cost of raising skill ratings by 1.
- Skill-based item requirement nodes can now process exotic skills.
- Fixed a bug where specializations could be bought for skills that only had ratings from skillsofts.
- Fixed a bug where the button to increase a knowledge skill in career mode would be clickable/enabled even when the knowledge skill could not actually be increased.
- Fixed an issue where martial arts technique names would not get properly translated.
- One Trick Pony will now automatically load any new techniques added to Chummer5 without having to update the quality's art's entry.
- Added the ability for limits to items to include attributes, base attributes, and limb counts. Also added the ability to resolve XPath operations in them.
- Added the ability for bonuses to add extra limbs. Shiva Arms (Pair) has been updated to reflect this, and the centaur metavariant starts with a new quality that adds two leg limbs.
- Fixed a bug where children of 'ware with a particular side (left or right) would not automatically inherit the side of their parent.
- Fixed a bug where Reapply Improvements would not reapply improvements from some nested gear and nested cyberware.
- Selecting the side of a piece of 'ware is now independent from selecting other bonuses. For example, this means custom cyberfingers will display both their custom function and the side to which they were added.
- Fixed a bug where the cyberware/bioware selection screen would not properly consider 'ware requirements.
- Fixed a bug where the technique from One Trick Pony would not be included in the limit of 5 techniques at character generation.
- Added preliminary handling of modular cyberlimbs. Modular cyberlimbs for vehicles need to be bought through the Cyberware tab and then equipped from there. There are some parts of the current implementation that rely on non-RAW rules because there is no way around it without being insane (e.g. modular limbs don't add essence, all essence is added via connectors); this is subject to change with official errata.
- KnowledgeSkillPoints Spent over the limit in Karma/Life Module are no longer subtracted from (non-existent) active SkillPoints. Instead the remaining points are negative and prevent crossing over to career mode.
- KnowledgeSkill with price reuction qualities (Linguist, College Education, etc) no longer have negative Karma cost.
- Fixed a bug where if knowledge skills are bought with karma in create mode, and the cost for buying new knowledge skills is set to a different value (in the options menu) from the cost of improving them, Chummer5 would not recognize that it needs to use the "new knowledge skill" cost for the first level instead of the "improve knowledge skill" cost.
- Fixed a crash caused by loading old character save files whose options do not have some of the categories looked for in newer versions of Chummer.
- Fixed a weird cutoff of the controls of some adept powers.
- Added a legacy shimmer that should catch and convert old cases of Improved Reflexes adept power to the new system, as these would not be fixed with Reapply Improvements.
- The mouse cursor will now change to "Waiting" mode while a character is being loaded in or while a character is getting their improvements re-applied.
- Re-apply improvements will now collect the names of outdated items and warn the user at the end to manually re-add them and/or to make sure they have all custom data files that they were previously using still present.
- Fixed a bug where bonuses that let you select an attribute would not record the choice in their parent item.
- Added code to properly fetch the data GUIDs of qualities in old save files made before quality GUIDs were saved, and added code to make sure qualities without data GUIDs would return an empty string when the data GUID is fetched instead of a GUID that corresponds to the empty GUID.
- Unhardcoded the entry for Technomancer Living Personas. It can now be modified via a gear entry that corresponds to it, and it can be set to be the active the same way a commlink can.
- Added the ability for bonuses to add gear.
- Added support for gear entries where altering quantities is not allowed.
- Matrix attributes will now automatically fill in the Data Processing value of the character's active commlink.

- Fixed a bug where the character validity checker would erroneously read maximum special attribute points as unspent special attribute points when deciding to show a warning about unspent special attribute points to the user. Fixes #2019.
- Fixed a bug where Re-Apply Improvements would not properly show newly populated items added by re-applied improvements.
- Fixed a bug where browsing weapons that came with accessories that came with gear that added bonuses would create a large list of "orphaned" improvements that would also show up when printing to a character sheet. Fixes #2013.
- Restored the ability to delete characters from the Character Roster by pressing Delete.
- Fixed a crash when adding stacking gear in career mode that occured if a stack already exists. Fixes #2026.
- Fixed a bug where manipulating stacking gear in career mode would not properly search through all children of an existing gear to make sure everything matches up before combining the two stacks.
- Fixed a bug where manipulating stacking gear that combines with an existing stack in career mode would not update the gear list entry of the existing stack if it was in a location other than the default one.
- Fixed a bug where trying to reload weapons in career mode would not allow use of ammo taken from a deeply nested location (i.e. it would only look one child deep).
- Changing languages in the Options menu now automatically re-populates the list of character sheets selectable as the default. If a non-English language is selected, only sheets for that language will show up.
- Fixed a bug where Chummer5 would only look at its first command line argument when seeing if it load characters at startup. Also fixes a bug where restarting Chummer5 after changing options with more than one character loaded would only load the first character after the restart.
- Fixed a bug where selecting to save changes to options but not to restart Chummer5 would not actually save changes to options.
- Fixed a bug where Chummer5 would not allow adding of alchemical preparations or ritual spells in create mode if the character was already at their character generation limit for regular skills. Fixes #2030.
- Fixed a bug where ritual spells could be taken as alchemical preparation recipes.
- Added the ability to check for the presence of a Martial Art in a required/forbidden node.
- Added the ability for Martial Arts and Martial Art Techniques to use required/forbidden nodes.

- Fixed a crash when removing cyberware that doesn't exist in data XMLs.
- Fixed a problem with specialisations not being able to be purchased if you didn't have the exact amount of Karma required.
- If a name and an id element are both specified inside an override node, then the name element is only used as an addition identifier if it has the "isidnode" attribute set to "yes". Also added support for using any elements as identifiers in override nodes, again using the "isidnode" attribute and setting it to "yes". Fixes #2038.
- Cyber-singularity Seeker and Redliner will now properly update when the character is loaded, and adding or removing Redliner will automatically update labels for the currently selected cyberlimb. Fixes #2036.
- Added the ability to specify metatype, age, sex, personal life, service type, hobbies/vice, and preferred payment method to contacts. Any non-blank fields out of those seven will get printed in any character sheet using a template from the Shadowrun 5 collection.
- Added the ability to add gear to armor mods. For now, this is only used by Full Body Armor helmet. Fixes #2043.
- Fixed a bug where adding a new vehicle mod to a vehicle would not automatically update the character's stats (most noticeable with the nuyen display).
- Fixed a bug with trying to add Customized Strength and Customized Agility to drone limbs equipped on drones with Body 0 and Pilot 0 respectively.
- Fixed a bug where Customized Strength and Customized Agility could be set to ratings when added to a drone limb that would cause no net attribute change.
- Fixed a bug where cyberware subsystems that increase their parent's availability would not do so when installed in a drone limb.
- Fixed a bug where cyberlimb stats and cyberlimb customizations would not automatically update with changes to vehicle attributes in both career and create mode and with changes to character attribute maxima in create mode.
- In case the maximum rating for a piece of 'ware is less than the minimum rating for it, it will automatically be hidden from the menu of 'ware available for purchase. Removed the outright forbidding of Customized Strength for Pixies, as it is no longer necessary. This should now also enable Pixies with a maximum STR of 4 or higher (e.g. via Exceptional Attribute + Genetic Optimization) to purchase cyberlimbs with customized STR, and will automatically catch cases where someone's maximum STR/AGI dips to 3 or below (e.g. Aged, Infirm, Impaired Attribute).
- Implemented a new bonus type for Street Cred Multiplier, to be used by the Consumnate Professional quality. Fixes #2048
- Implemented a new bonus type for Street Cred, allowing Improvements to provide bonuses to Street Cred directly. Currently unused by anything. 
- Removed the increase to Notoriety that Enemies provide, as it's not a relevant rule in SR5.
- Fixed a bug where the updater form could not be re-opened after it has been closed once.
- Fixed crashes related to the user's connection to GitHub getting severed mid-update.
- Fixed the few-second delay encountered when launching the updater form.
- The optional rule for karma costs to increase special attributes not being decreased by essence loss now works and saves its value properly. It is implemented by having essence loss affect the attribute's augmented value instead of its maxima and minima, and characters burn out if their augmented reduction from essence loss becomes greater than their current maximum. Fixes #1808.
- Fixed a bug where tooltips for skill groups would not be updated properly.
- Fixed a bug where removing sources for special skills would not also remove skill groups.
- Fixed a bug where current priority settings would not get properly saved for if you wish to change priorities in create mode.
- Fixed a bug where removing/altering sources for free skill levels would not properly update the skill section with altered ratings. Fixes #1340.
- Fixed bugs where enabling the house rule for strict interpretation of skill group breaking in create mode would also affect characters in career mode.
- Fixed a bug where certain selectable bonuses and extras would not get translated when using a localization different from the default English (US) one.
- Fixed a bug where adding karma to an adept in career mode would sometimes cause sometimes Chummer5 to crash. Fixes #2050.
- Fixed the Automatic Updates option not working properly. The automatic updater has been updated as well to run silently in the background until an update is ready to be applied instead of forcing the user to click through an updater window. It also checks for updates every hour as well instead of just at startup. Manually checking for updates while the automatic updater is running in the background will make the visible updater window take over the automatic updater instead of trying to launch its own, separate instance of the updater.
- Fixed the warning for using an older version of Chummer5a to open a character made in a newer version.
- Fixed rare crashes for when certain strings had a null value instead of being empty. Possible fix for #2054.
- Fixed a bug where not having drone modding rules enabled caused the max armor for drones to be calculated as twice the drone's armor instead of the drone's armor + the drone's body.
- Fixed a bug where if Chummer5 encountered an error while saving a character, it would still assume that the character was saved properly.
- Added the ability to select a value other than 2 or 4 for the amount of decimal places to consider for essence costs.
- Fixed a bug where Mentor's Mask would apply the Adept/Magician bonus from the chosen Mentor Spirit twice.

- Fixed a bug where the "Hide Items Over Availability Limit" checkbox would show up in career mode even though it would have no effect.
- Checking the "Hide Items Over Availability Limit" checkbox will now also automatically set an item's maximum rating so that it cannot exceed the availability limit.
- Implemented the ability to rename the Extra text of Gear items with the selecttext improvement while in Career mode. This functionality will be extended to other categories (Weapons, Armour, etc.) as time permits.
- Character sheets are now printed with the number formatting of the language in which they are printed instead of with the number formatting of the language of the user's current operating system.
- Fixed a bug related to incorrect printing of certain numbers due to differences in decimal separators. Fixes #2069.
- Fixed a bug where some context menu strips would not get translated.
- Fixed a bug where Re-Apply Improvements would add improvements for items that were not equipped.
- Fixed a bug where Custom Items would not save their custom names when using a localisation other than en-US. Fixes #2073.
- Characters that did not properly assign a Type to their Knowledge skills will now be able to change it.
- Re-Apply Improvements can now handle Stacked Foci.
- Fixed the Guids of Skills and Skill Groups not being properly loaded from a saved character. Fixes #2081.
- Added the ability to directly add Armour to an Armor Bundle.
- Fixed a bug where buying a separate metamagic or enhancement in career mode would check against the karma cost of buying spells instead of the karma cost of getting a metamagic or enhancement respectively.
- Fixed a bug where wound modifiers were applied twice to knowledge skill dicepools.
- Fixed a bug where karma modifiers to spell cost where not factored into calculations regarding whether the character has enough karma to buy a new spell.
- Unhardcoded the karma cost modifications added by Uneducated, Uncouth, Myostatin Inhibitor, Jack of All Trades, College Education (RF), Linguist, School of Hard Knocks, and Technical School Education. These modifications are now available and fully modifiable through individual tags inside of bonus nodes.
- Transferred the house rule of education qualities applying their karma costs in create mode from a checkbox in the options menu to a custom ruleset. Users who had this rule previously enabled will need to re-enable it.
- Selecting an armor, a piece of 'ware, a gear, a quality, a vehicle, or a weapon now properly saves the currently selected value of the category selection box instead of the selected item's category. This does not apply if the search box is not empty and the option to search only in the selected category is disabled.
- Added support for improvements that block being able to buy specializations for particular skills or skill categories.
- Unhardcoded the focus bonding cost modification effects of Adept Ways, and unhardcoded the bonuses offered by Burnout's Way (access to Burnout's Way grade) and Magician's Way (can discount all powers other than Improved Reflexes). These effects are now available and fully modifiable through individual tags inside of bonus nodes.
- Focus bonding cost modifications from Adept Ways now be automatically applied in both Create and Career mode, and their karma effects will automatically be calculated by the time the user is prompted to spend karma on binding a new focus. Removed the numerical up-down in Create mode for the number of foci eligible for Adept Way discounts, as it is now obsolete.
- Fixed a bug where re-applying or re-adding improvements of items that would add the Improved Ability (skill) adept power would not properly end up adding that power.
- Fixed a bug where improvements that would ask the user to select an adept power to add would not abide by the "ignorerating" node when it was present.
- Added a house rule that changes Mystic Adepts so that instead of using special rules for obtaining and managing PP, they will have a separate MAG rating to be used for Adept powers and PP. Initiation and Foci will use the lower of the two MAG ratings if this rule is enabled.
- Fixed a bug where if points and/or karma were allocated to a special attribute to which access was later removed in Create mode, those points and/or karma would not get freed up.
- Weapons can now add more weapons (not just underbarreled weapons).
- Handedness now prints in a localized fashion, and will now display the appropriate value if the character is ambidextrous. Part of fix for #2098.
- Fixed translations for contact tabs and contact controls. Part of fix for #2098.
- Fixed weapon mount strings not being localized in the UI displaying info about a selected weapon. Part of fix for #2098.

- Added a house rule where characters can take an unlimited amount of Positive Qualities, but any quality karma costs in excess of the limit set in options are doubled, as if they were taken in career mode.
- Players may now alter starting karma and maximum karma-to-nuyen for characters in Create mode alongside altering maximum availability.
- Fixed a bug where the character sheet viewer screen from printing multiple characters would not allow any open characters to be changed, and would produce a blank sheet if the language was changed.
- Story Builder will now calculate the runner's age and birth year using the current year + 72 as the present year instead of it being fixed to 2075.
- Altered behaviour of the Made Man and Prime Datahaven Membership qualities to unbind forcing the Loyalty to 1/3 from being a Group.
- Added an option where Essence will not be rounded internally, only for display purposes. Technically, it will always be rounded to 28 decimal places if the option is enabled, as that is the maximum precision of the variable type used to store Essence and Essence costs.
- Added options for formatting how many decimal places are always displayed for Nuyen and how many places can possibly displayed in total. Chummer5a will always keep track of costs to 28 decimal places' worth of precision regardless of these options. Fixes #2094.
- Fixed issues regarding Enchantment spells not being properly added or re-added in certain cases.
- Fixed a bug where PACKS kits containing spells would add them to the wrong categories and would completely ignore Rituals and Enchantments.
- Added the ability to define custom karma costs for knowledge skill specializations different from active skill ones. Fixes #2113.
- Added the ability to define a custom flat cost for initiations and submersions instead of it being always set to 10.
- Fixed a bug where saving a character to a new file when the character's form would be closed due to Chummer wishing to restart itself would end up with Chummer not re-opening the character when it started back up.
- Added an option where changes to a character's savefile that happen outside of Chummer (e.g. via syncing folders in Dropbox) would make Chummer automatically reload the character's information if the character has no pending changes to be saved. Normally the user would have to watch for changes themselves and if there are any, they would have to close the character and then re-open them to load in any changes.
- Added a houserule where increasing the rating of a skill in a skill group when all the other skills have a higher rating compensates for the karma difference between increasing a skill group rating and increasing the rating of all skills in the skill group.
- Any and all GitHub contributors of past, present, and future are now immortalized in a list on the About screen.
- Moved Complex Form Context Menu Strip into the treenodes for each complex form to bring it back into line with the usual standard, removed it from the button.
- Fixed a crash when moving characters between the "Favorites" and "Recent" lists in the character roster.
- The "Favorites" list will now be shown in the character roster even when it is empty so that characters can immediately be moved to it.
- Double clicking a character on the character roster (or opening a character file linked to a contact, pet, or spirit) who is already open will now switch to the character's tab instead of attempting to open a new tab of the character. Open characters are now marked with an asterisk. If there are more than 10 characters open, open characters will still show up in the "Recent" list.
- Fixed a bug where testing a PDF inside the options menu would automatically save the currently selected options, which would cause them to be applied even if the user would choose not to apply changes to options in the prompt when they exited the options menu.
- Contacts, Pets, and Spirits linked to character files will automatically load those files in the background and fill in and update appropriate fields based on values in their linked file.
- Fixed a bug where pet metatypes/species labels in the Relationships tab were not translated properly.
- Added a proof-of-concept helper combobox that has a variable-width dropdown and tooltip functionality to assist with long text, such as sheet names in the options.
- Sheets printing free expenses is now something that can be toggled off in the options menu. Fixes #1800.
- Fixed a bug where having the Adapsin version of a grade for a piece of 'ware would cause it to not load the proper amount of Matrix Condition Monitor boxes.
- Fixed a bug where characters with Gammaware and/or the Adapsin versions of Betaware, Deltaware, and Gammaware would pass the character validity check for Career mode.
- Unhardcoded the device rating values of 'ware grades. They can now be modified with custom data files.
- Added the ability to perform a clean reinstall from within the updater.
- Added the ability to have Martial Arts with karma costs different from the default of 7.
- When warning about duplicate GUIDs in data files, Chummer5a will now display the names of the items to which those duplicate IDs belong.
- In addition to checking for duplicate GUIDs, Chummer5a will now also check for ID fields that do not contain GUIDs, and if it finds any, it will warn users in a manner similar to the warning for duplicate GUIDs.
- Fixed a bug where items that both consumed capacity and had capacity did not cause selection forms to enforce their maximum capacity remaining. Fixes #1806.
- The Shadowrun 5 character sheet set will now print the various resistance dicepools that the character has. Fixes #1935.
- Fixed the use of sensor upgrades to replace the current rating rather than adding to it.

Data Changes:

- Corrected the text of Seducer mentor spirit's adept bonus to match the one found in the core rulebook.
- Corrected the page number references of Forbidden Arcana mentor spirits.
- Spider (Alt) now properly gives 2 levels of Spirit Claw instead of 1. (Yes, Spirit Claw does not have levels, so Forbidden Arcana will need to be errata'd, but Chummer5 can handle this sort of thing regardless)
- Changed the name of "Great Mother" mentor spirit from SASS to "Great Mother (SASS)" to differentiate it from an identically named mentor spirit from Forbidden Arcana.
- Improved Ability can no longer be taken for skills that have a rating of 0, as 0 x1.5 is still 0. This extends to Mentor Spirits that would give free levels of Improved Ability.
- Implemented content from Shadows in Focus: Metropole. Life Modules are untested because they're awful.
- Reakt and Combat Sense now give dodge bonuses.
- Barehanded Adept can now be taken by Mystic Adepts as well, and it will now properly provide free Touch-ranged spells that use Unarmed Combat in place of Spellcasting.
- Fixed non-Awakened characters being eligible to take Mastery and Blood Crystal qualities from Forbidden Arcana.
- When free spell points are available at chargen, and real spell costs (costs charged for the character) are not greater than unmodified spell costs (costs set in Options), all Mastery qualities from Forbidden Arcana will now deduct from spell points instead of from free karma at a rate of 1 point per [unmodified spell cost] karma, rounded down (so e.g. at 5 karma per spell, an 8 karma Mastery quality will cost 1 spell point and 3 karma instead of 8 karma).
- All Blood Crystal qualities now properly reduce both condition monitors by 1 for each bonded crystal. Crystal Breath, Crystal Eye, Crystal Gut, Crystal Jaw, Crystal Limb, and Crystal Spine now properly reduce Essence, but in a way that does not affect the character's MAG rating.

- Fixed a bug where Basic and Full levels of the Insomnia quality were not mutually exclusive.
- Fixed a bug where Bilingual Black Market Connection, and all Phenotypic Variations could be taken in-game.

- Corrected the range entries for the following weapon entries: Urban Tribe Tomahawk, Shuriken, Chakram, Trafalgar Gun Cane, Knockoff Gun Cane, Parashield Dart Rifle, Flametosser, Mounted Crossbow, Underbarrel Shotgun.
- Properly applied a bonus to the Master Archer power.
- High Pain Tolerance quality is now mutually exclusive from Damage Compensator bioware and Pain Resistance Adept power (Pain Editor is not banned because its effects are not passive).
- Damage Compensators now properly respond to condition monitors getting filled. Fixes #821.

- Added entries for all the items that come with a Survival Kit and a Survival Knife.
- Fixed Control Rig not coming with a built-in datajack or sim module. Fixed Datajack not coming with a meter of Universal Connector Cord.
- Fixed all entries for commlinks, cyberdecks, and RCCs to properly represent the items they come with. Also fixed specialty cyberdecks so that they cannot rearrange their attributes.
- Added an entry for the Hackpack Cyberdeck Form Factor. As per the core rulebook, it is free.
- Fixed Sensors, Sensor Functions, Fake Licenses, all Audio Devices, all Video Devices, all Audio Enhancements, all Video Enhancements, all Armor Enhancements, Commlink/Cyberdeck Form Factors, and Altskin plugins from being able to accommodate incorrect plugins and/or from being added as an incorrect plugin.
- Added a set of custom rules that makes Adapsin's essence multiplier apply as a generic multiplier after all others (the way it does in Hero Lab) instead of a multiplier to grade essence costs.

At present, only Spirits should be available for use. Sprites and other critters will be enabled in a later patch. Fixes #1225

- Moved the AddQualities improvement nodes for qualities, cyberware and such into the Bonus node. This shouldn't affect existing characters, but custom content will need to be adjusted to reflect the change.
- Moved the method for the SelectText improvement. I don't EXPECT that this will cause any issues, but if you encounter any odd behaviour please let us know.

- Fixed an incorrect label for skill improvements in the Karma/Nuyen Expense History. Fixes #1046.
- Fixed an issue that caused knowledge skills to revert their type to Interest. Fixes #1056.
- Added an option to treat arms and legs as the only limbs to average cyberlimb stats off, instead of the skull and torso that are suggested by RAW. As part of this, the options have been broken out into a new XML file, options.xml. Minor design note, I intend to eventually have every calculation variable kept outside of the application logic itself; this will allow GMs to configure their characters as they wish.

- Fixed an issue where changing your priority selection would remove MAG/RES-linked skills.

- Fixed a UI issue that prevented attribute bonuses from showing properly if the value made it into double digits.

- Temporarily removed the CalculatedMovementSpeed tooltip from caeer and creation mode until it gets refacted.
- Added a workaround to prevent crashes when loading characters with empty knowledge skills. Fixes #1099.

- The "ignoreprecedence" improvement attribute has been renamed to "precedence-1".
- The initiativepass and initiativepassadd improvements now utilise precedence values to manage their stacking; this allows adding Improvements that will always apply, such as the Infected Initiative die bonuses.

- Fixed an issue that prevented the Knowledge/Contact multiplier house rules from enabling correctly.
- Changed the string Tip_SkillsKnowledgeSkills to display the correct multiplier entry.

- Fixed an issue with the Matrix condition monitor.
- Fixed behaviour of the houserule to use Total Value of INT + LOG for Knowledge skills.

Data Changes:

Fixes #880.
- Fixed a bug where changing between technomancers and mages would leave both resonance and magical skills available. Fixes #890.
- Altered the uniquename for the Damage Resistance improvement to allow stacking, instead of using the highest single bonus. This may be wrong, but I can't find any RAW statements against it. Fixes #879.

Build 180:
Application Change:
- Total rewrite of skills.
    * Eliminated a lot (all?) old bugs
    * Opening the skills tab first time is now signifigantly faster
    * Searchbox for skills
    * Custom sorting of skills. Sort by Rating, Dicepool, Category and more
    * Skill tooltip now display dicepools for cyberarms
    * In Career mode, it is possible to calculate the dicepool using another attribute that the default one.
    * Some minor UI changes to acomodate new skill features
    * Skills that cannot be defaulted has their name in italics.
    * Easier maintainance
    * Reduced file size
- First things first, good news bad news. Good news, automatic updates will be functional again for updates after 179. Bad news, due to a change in implementation of the automatic updates this brings an end to .Net 4.0 support. Chummer will no longer launch without .Net 4.5 or higher installed on your system.
- Rewrote crash handling. Now dumps most/all internal state, making debugging easier.
- Built-in weapon accessories are automatically assigned to the Internal accessory slot by default. If a weapon accessory should take up a slot naturally, just add a <mount> value to the accessory. This change only affects newly created/purchased weapons, so any existing weapons will need to be altered manually or deleted and re-added. Fixes #566.
- Ammunition can now add and replace the fire modes of weapons, using the firemode and firemodereplace nodes of weaponbonus. This change only takes effect during career mode, and is currently used exclusively for the Taurus Omni-6's heavy ammo type. Fixes #577.
- Fixed a crash issue caused by changing priority selection in Sum to Ten mode. Fixes #572.
- Qualities can have their Limit assigned as either 'no' or a numeric value. This is intended as something of a placeholder until proper levels for qualities are implemented at a later date.
- Support for AI characters added. Xeno/Protosapients and E-Ghosts are treated as Metavariants.
- Weapon Accessories can now modify the AP, Damage and FireMode of weapons using the damage, damagereplace, damagetype, ap, apreplace, firemode and firemodereplace keys. Currently this is used exclusively for the Overclocked mod (Okay technically it's currently an accessory, but there's no practical difference between the two at the moment so it goes where I say it goes.) Fixes #472
- Handling for vehicles has been split up into normal and offroad handling. The implementation method should prevent any issues from cropping up, but I've eaten my hat on that before.
- Calendar entries can now be removed. Fixes #552.
- The optional rule to have Essence Loss only reduce RES/MAG maximums has been re-enabled. Fixes #596.
- Each spare clip added to a weapon now tracks ammo individually rather than the previous hard-coded limit of four active slots. As a result of this change, Spare Clips no longer have the ability to directly store ammunition as a child item; they will be updated to display their currently loaded ammunition as an Extra value shortly.
- New key node for Weapon Accessories: ammoslot. ammoslot is an integer that adds the associated number of 'spare clip' items to the parent weapon. In most cases this will be 1 (Spare Clip, Speed Loader, etc.), but someone will probably come up with banana magazines that count as two mags or something eventually. Future proofing!
- Qualities can now add natural weapons directly using the naturalweapons node. Mostly this is for the infected, because "Bite (Infected) 2" offends me.
- Fixed a string formatting issue that prevented Accuracy modifications from adept powers from working properly for translated Chummer.
- Fixed an issue that prevented priority/sum-to-ten from using the gameplay options for their nuyen limit.
- Sum to Ten and Priority now use the same form for character generation. Doesn't mean anything particularly interesting for you guys, but may reduce or introduce some interesting new bugs.
- Contacts can now be dragged around and reordered according to your whims. It's only really easy to do when the control you want to move is expanded.
- Armor can now have a Rating; currently this is used exclusively for the cloaks from Hard Targets.
- Fixed the percentage discount for basic lifestyles.
- Fixed a translation issue for licences.
- Fixed a translation issue for basic lifestyles. Fixes #608.
- Armor improvements can now use Precedence attributes; this means that we can prevent a group of armour improvements from stacking with each other. Currently this is used for a small selection of skin-related qualities and biowares. See the Data Changes for more details. Fixes #602.
- Fixed an issue with advanced lifestyles that created zombie qualities. Fun for the vodoun and shedim, everyone else not so much. Fixes #583.
- Fixed an issue that prevented infected from moving to career mode.
- Added a tooltip for the Movement label in the Other Info tab to show the calculated movement speed in meters per combat turn or Kilometres per Hour. Implements #574.
- Note tooltips now have a maximum with of 100 pixels. Prevents the tooltips for contact descriptions and such from running across the whole screen. There's a good chance I missed one or two, so let me know if you see any. Fixes #581.
- Fixed an issue relating to the Improved Ability power causing other powers to revert to 0 ranks. Fixes #488, fixes #436, fixes #378.
- Fixed an issue with Improved Ability and exotic weapon skills not working together. Fixes #492.
- Fixed adept powers to stack properly with free levels from qi foci and mentor spirits. May break in interesting ways. Should fix #615.
- Matrix initiative can now benefit from the MatrixIniaitivePass improvement. Fixes #618.
- Added support for FixedValues for vehicle mods. Fixes #622.
- Exotic Weapon skills without any karma spent on them can now be removed once you've entered career mode.
- Exotic Weapon skills can now properly have their karma costs refunded in career mode.
- Exotic Weapon skills can't change their specialisation dynamically anymore once you're in career mode, because it breaks the karma refund. This is intentional and is unlikely to be changed unless you can present me with better-implemented code or a reason it shouldn't be like it is.
- Skill specializations will now save their value as the English string if possible rather than whatever the user enters; this should fix #595. Note that this fix is PROBABLY not retroactive.
- Fixed some issues with lifestyle qualities not saving properly if they contained an extra value. Fixes #623.
- Active Hardwires now implemented according to the rules, fixes #617. They're effectively similar to skillwires, but you select the affected skill at the time of purchase. They're currently mutually exclusive, so you can't have skillwires and hardwires affecting the same skill. As with skillwires, the character's actual rating and their hardwire rating don't stack.
- Fixed an issue that prevented accessories that came with a weapon from being flagged as Internal.
- Fixed some calculation issues for priority metatypes not showing the correct karma value when changing from a metavariant to a base metatype. Fixes #537.
- Fixed a crash with metavariants in Priority/Sum to Ten. Fixes #647.
- Fixed a crash caused by weapon accessories that have a cost based on rating. Fixes #650, fixes #656.
- Added spell defence calculations in a tab on the right side of the career and creation windows. Closes #573.
- Changed the Improved Potential powers to use the limit modifier bonus instead of selectlimit; makes it a bit neater.
- Did some stuff to enable selecting multiple powers through the selectpower bonus node. This shouldn't affect any existing characters, but if you're using the Chaos Mentor Spirit I'd recommend deleting it and removing it. This miiiiight also break existing characters with Qi Foci. Probably not though. Like 70/30 at most.
- Did various shenanigans with the karma selection form to make it show qualities and karma costs properly.
- Rebuilt the functionality for Black Market Pipeline nad the Dealer Connection quality. Both should now work properly; there's a teeny tiny chance that existing characters that have the qualities might break, please raise a ticket if so.
- Fixed a crash caused by adding Genemods to a character with the Burnout's Way. Fixes #674.
- Fixed a UI issue that left the dropdown null when switching between genemods and bioware. Fixes #674.
- Enabled Vehicle Modifications to gain flat increases to Speed,Handling or Acceleration based on the Rating of the mod. Partial fix for #675.
- Fixed a visual bug with Limit Modifiers in creation mode. Fixes #665.
- Expanded the category selection mechanism to support falling back to default values. The general idea is that for each priority category loaded, it will attempt to load nodes that have a gameplayoptions node. If it can't do that, it'll load the Standard settings instead. This is intended to support alternate gameplay options as requested by #357. The actual data will need to be added for the appropriate categories, which I really can't be bothered transcribing.
- New Feature: Weapon Mounts will now limit the available weapons based on a predefined list of weapon categories. This also enables the weapon mounts added in Rigger 5.0 for adding weapons. I'm not particularly happy with how this looks in the XML so the underlying code might get changed over time. For now it's all good though.
- Fixed an issue that prevented magic- or reseonance-enabled karma-created characters from moving to Career mode.
- New Feature: Added a bunch of prompts to warn the user if they still have free contact points, knowledge points, skill points and such before moving to Career mode.
- Fixed an issue that caused a crash when adding armour to vehicles and drones.
- Partially implemented the Overclocker feature for Career mode. Code works, but I haven't added it on for Vehicles yet. Fixes #198.
- Added support for CTRL-A in the Notes forms. Slim chance I've missed other multiline forms Fixes #693.
- Fixed a crash caused by loading custom Critters related to movement strings.
- Fixed the display of Locations created by cybewrware or weapons with AllowGear properties. Fixes #536.
- Added some support for creating an Ally Spirit, per #244. Not 100% RAW yet, but it doesn't crash so that's a start.
- Added support for enabling calculated Public Awareness, per the rules from SR4. Hides the tooltips and calculations if not in use.
- Fixed the creation method for custom packs kits to not treat included mods as being purchased. Should fix #707 and fix #691.
- Save files is now in UTF-8 instead of UTF-16. This should not have any visible impact but it is more tool frindly and leads to smaller files
- Fixed an issue where qualities that add other qualities for free didn't discount properly. Fixes #762.
- Fixed an issue where default build methods other than Karma would cause a crash while launching the Options menu. Fixes #796.
- Fixed an issue with the Acceleration Enhancement modification causing a crash when printing. Fixes #772.
- Fixed an occasional issue in the Options menu where a null default character sheet caused a crash. Fixes #774.

- Fixed a bonus point calculation issue for YNT Softweave and Cloaks.
- Fixed a crash issue related to the Overclocker quality in career mode.
- Fixed a loading issue for commlinks with armor capacity values.
- Fixed an issue where removing a Foci before unbonding it would leave the Improvement enabled. Fixes #660. Note: Characters that have already been affected by this bug will need to manually remove the improvement.
- Fixed the ability to switch between adepts, magicians or technomancers when changing priority selections. Fixes #745.
- Added a method for grouping armour value improvements with the 'group' attribute. Fixes #758.
- Fixed an issue that prevented some old characters from being saved. Fixes #806.
- Added and consolidated some code to update initiation costs and discounts properly. Fixes #810.
- Implemented a minor quality of life update; the most recently used folder location is not stored for mugshots, per character. Fixes #458.
- Contacts, spirits and pets can now be linked to non-Chummer files; when clicking on the Open Character Sheet button, the file will be opened in the default application for that extension. Fixes #636.
- Prime runners now get twice the amount of free contacts compared to standard
- Essence Hole value is not impacted by grade or ware essence cost reductions. You don't get a little essence back each time now. Fixes #673
- "Test Subject" and "Factory Child Worker" life modules now give bonus nuyen. Fixes #811
- Fixed a crash caused when saving characters without mugshots.
- Fixed an incorrect value for binding spirit services. Fixes #827.
- Fixed karma costs for the Inspired quality from Sail Away, Sweet Sister in karmagen. Fixes #828.
- Added a close icon for the Options window, allows you to cancel out of saving any changes you make. Should fix #700.

Build 178:
Application Change:
- Fixed a calculation issue for the Edge attribute when using Sum-To-Ten or Priority.
- Fixed a crash issue caused when adding commlinks and cyberdecks.
- Standard Knowledge Skills are suffixed with the Category they're a part of. There's a minor issue that preserves the skill name until the character is next loaded that will be fixed later.
- Clicking Add Again on the Spell Selection menu will preserve the currently opened spell categories. This is more or less just a proof of concept and will be expanded to other forms in later patches.

Build 177:
Application Change:
- Fixed a crash when selecting positive lifestyle qualities.
- Life Module backstories are now generated by a button press on the Character Info page.
- Print Preview mode is accessible from a context menu in the Character Print Viewer.
- Vehicles, Cyberware and Drones now have a Matrix Condition Monitor tracker. Note; the cyberware CM is effectively limited to 'root' devices, as in cyberlimbs, Wired Reflexes, things you wouldn't normally expect to be attached to other things. While I can fiddle with this setting easily enough, a bit of internal testing just left my testers confused as to whether they were bricking the parent device or not. Looking for feedback on this.
- Refactored a chunk of the Improvements code to use the new Log formatting. Mostly just stops it from throwing warnings at me during builds, but is a bit more human-readable.
- Fixed a bug that stopped lifestyle qualities from loading properly when edited.
- Fixed an incorrectly calculated Drain value.
- The Create Natural Weapon form can now select STR in addition to the current STR/2 option.
- Fixed an issue that caused the prompt for adding an enhancement metamagic to show the wrong value.
- Fixed an issue with Basic Lifestyles not being editable.
- Fixed an issue with Lifestyle costs not calculating correctly for metatypes and some other edge cases.
- The Adept Powers panel now includes an automatic scroll button that triggers when the list of powers exceeds the panel height.
- Fixed some issues with genemods being able to benefit from cyber/bioware grades.
- Gear and Cyberware can now use the variable value Parent Cost in a similar manner to Weapon Cost for weapon accessories. Currently this is used exclusively for the Implant Medic Hard Nanoware.
- Concealability modifiers for Gear can now be based on Rating. Currently used for the Extended Clip modifier.
- Fixed a calculation issue for lifestyle qualities.
- Fixed some issues that cropped up for 'ware that adds qualities (Daredrenaline, Metatype Reduction, etc.)
- Implemented support for selecting the slot that a weapon modiciation occupies. May break in interesting ways, but should allow holdouts and such to attach spare clips again.
- Commlinks and cyberdecks can now switch their ASDF attributes around. This capability will be properly segregated out into Cyberdecks in a later patch.
- Previous Priority selections are preserved when you use the Change Priority Selection button in Create Mode. Fixes #497.
- Fixed an issue that stopped Sum to Ten from completing properly.
- Fixed some calculation and appearance issues for special attributes.
- Build Summary for Primary and Special Attributes during Priority/Sum to Ten now shows Karma cost in addition to point cost expenditure.
- Fixed a crash in the Spell Selection window caused by clicking the Accept Form button with a Category node selected.

Data Change:
- Fixed an issue with Cloaks from HT that caused a crash.
- Fixed missing data values for discounted adept powers.
- Adept Way Discount values enabled for all eligible powers (IE, anything except powers that cost .25.)
- Fixed an issue with gas-vents that caused a crash.
- Renamed the Low-Light Vision metagenetic quality to prevent it from clashing with the metatype quality.
- Renamed the Magic Sense metagenetic quality to prevent it from clashing with the metatype quality.
- Fixed incorrect data values for the Extreme Cyber-Implant weapon.
- Hard Nanoware from Chrome Flesh has been added. Because of the way it interacts with cyberware, the Implant Medic is listed as a piece of cyberware.
- Altered the way Weapon Accessories are handled to enable pre-configured Ratings. Custom-made weapons with built-in accessories will need to have their format changed to <accessories><accessory<name>Whatever</name></accessory></accessories>. Existing characters should load properly; please contact me if you run into any issues with this.
- Fixed a crash caused by the Extended Clip.
- Added Nanoware from Chrome Flesh.
- Proper bonuses added for most of the genetech from Chrome Flesh. Myostatin Inhibitor still doesn't have the karma discount, because it's tedious to implement.
- Fixed the minimum INT for Wakyambi to 2.
- Holdouts have had the <allowaccessory> tag set to true as a result of code changes to how accessories can be attached to a weapon. May not take effect on existing weapons; if not, remove and re-add the weapon.
- Renamed the description for the Cat Mentor to not refer to Infiltration.
- Removed the Sail Away, Sweet Sister version of the Personalised Grip, as it's replaced by the Hard Targets version.

New String:
- Menu_FilePrintPreview

Renamed String:
- String_OverContactPoints renamed to String_OverPriorityPoints

Build 176:
Application Change:
- Gauss Ammo is now considered ammo for heavy weapons instead of normal guns.
- Free contacts don't violate the (C+L)>7 limit when creating a character. This allows prime dataheaven membership to pass inspection...
- Changed the default value for maritial art techniques to cost 5 instead or 4 karma, to conform with official rules. For older instalations, delete the settings file or change this in options.
- When selecting life modules that brings an attribute above chargen limit, chummer don't crash anymore.
- Reflex recorder now properbly affects skills linked to a physical attribute instead of the physical skill group.
- Redliner and Cyber Singularity Seeker now grant the proper bonuses.
- Fixed a crash caused by double-clicking Spell Categories.
- Implemented an Improvement node for Public Awareness increases.
- Fixed Jack of All Trades (The Career and Create versions were switched.)

- Fixed an issue that stopped rulebook selections from saving properly.
- Fixed an issue in Life Modules if trying to add more than one Real Life Module.
- Prototype Transhuman works. Personal new metric: if I get more than twenty requests for a quality to be implemented within a month of the book coming out, that quality is broken.
- Made some changes to the calculation method for a character's Metagenetic Limit. Fixes an issue with the changeling limit being set incorrectly to 0 or making certain metagenetic qualities flag as standard.
- Weapon Accessories can have Ratings. Currently for things like Ceramic Components that have multiple levels.
- Fixed an issue with Weapon Costs caused by Ceramic Components.
- Fixed an error caused by Life Modules trying to give you attribute points over your metatype limit.
- Qualities that are not yet implemented in code will now have an <implemented>no</implemented> key that highlights them in red.
- New improvement node type: <selectimprovements>. This allows us to perform the selectattribute improvement more than once for a particular quality. This is mostly used for the Infected pseudo-quality.
- Fixed the method for generating Advanced Lifestyle LP.

Data Change:
- Poor Self Control (Attention Seeking, Sadistic) now properly grant karma.
- First-pass addition of Hard Targets content has been added. Big thanks to Reddit's /u/Fweeba and HaikenEdge.
    Some provisional issues:
    - Adept Spell does not work properly.
    - There are a few items that use Ratings in ways that haven't previously been required (Ie, the cloaks), so they're not as clean as I'd otherwise like.
- Ares Thuderstruck Gauss Rifle renamed to Ares Thunderstruck Gauss Rifle.
- The Fame qualities provide the associated Public Awareness increases.
- Added prompts for sides (Left, Right) for most cyberware that could reasonably be expected to need it.
- The Improved Potential power has been split up into three different powers, due to the way it works. Characters that have the existing power should work fine.
- Bioware Limbs from Chrome Flesh added.
- Additional Life Modules added. Most Life Modules now have a random story attached. The bulk of these stories are jokes, because it's good to laugh. Note: Checking and unchecking the Automatic Backstory checkbox on the Character Info page will select new random values, if they're present.
- Removed the Extravagant Eyes metagenetic quality.
- Fixed Karma values for the Cyclops Eye, Vestigial Tail and Feathers metagenetic qualities.
- The Extended Masking Metamagic has been enabled as a power Adepts can take, as it's functionally identical to the Improved Masking power.

- Fixed a crash caused by lifestyles with qualities.
- Fixed a crash when selecting the drug Snuff.

Build 175:
Application Change:

- You can now press Ctrl-W to close a character file.
- Fixed an issue with purchasing additional months of a lifestyle in career mode.
- Fixed an issue with lifestyle qualities that had the selecttext bonus.
- The Quality selector will show negative metagenetic qualities by default, but hide positive ones unless you're a Changeling.
- Support for the Trust Fund quality added.
- The Technomancer registered sprite limit is now based on LOG instead of CHA.
- Fixed an issue with the cyberware selection screen not showing Essence costs.
- Complex Forms show their translated name properly.
- Redid how basic lifestyles work. Should make them behave better, should prevent crashes for older characters.
- Fixed an issue that caused initiation schooling to show as a nuyen gain in the karma/nuyen log.

Data Change:
- Nanohive crash issue fixed.
- Ratings for the Expanded Volume and Amplified Immune System bioware fixed to 4.
- Fixed incorrect category for certain rituals.
- Missing drugs from Chrome Flesh added. Custom drugs aren't implemented yet. As an interim, you can use Custom Item to emulate the drugs.
- Fixed incorrect data for the Nitama Sporter.

String Changes:
- Message_CharacterOptions_OpenOptions
- MessageTitle_CharacterOptions_OpenOptions

Build 174:
Application Change:
- Calculation of Essence discounts is now multiplicative instead of additive. I am assured this is a good thing.
- Fixed the default values for free karma knowledge. If you have an existing settings file, please reset to defaults by clicking Tools > Options > Karma Costs > Reset to Default.
- Issues with Sum to Ten character generation artifically granting a MAG value higher than the metatype maximum should be fixed. I expect it'll break again in a week or so somehow, so please let me know if you experience any issues.
- Chummer's main window now shows the current version in the title to aid troubleshooting.
- Fixed a crash issue with Dwarves and the Resistance to Pathogens/Toxins metaquality, courtesy of Argo2445.
- Fixed a crash caused by missing information in SURGE qualities.
- Fixed a crash when trying to add items that include the selecttext bonus to vehicles.
- Public Awareness is no longer an automatically calculated value.
- Positive Metagenetic Qualities are hidden by default UNLESS you have one of the Changeling qualities, or disable the 'hide qualities I can't take' checkbox. Not particularly happy with the implementation for this; feedback appreciated.

Data Change:
- Magical Education Life Module now has a proper karma cost; prevents crashes.
- Myostatin Inhibitor genemod now adds 1 Strength. The karma cost needs additional code support and hasn't been implemented properly yet.
- Fixed skill usage for cyber implant weapons.
- Fixed missing categories for the Attention-Seeking and Sadistic variants of Poor Self Control.
- Fixed an issue with the Net weapon that caused a crash.
- Fixed a crash issue with the Trauma Damper, courtesy of SolitarySky.
- Changed the Priority B Elf's Special points to 6.

Translation Changes:
- Added French translations courtesy of sethsatan.

Build 173:
Application Change:
- Dumpshock link changed to issue tracker.
- A First-pass effort at adding a filter for Missions-restricted items has been added to the Options menu. Will be getting a later review to enable better filtering of the qualities, but for now it's just a global option.
- Fixed a bug with life modules where Tír Tairngire wouldn't show demographics.
- Chummer now handles essence holes automatically. Old items may need to be re-added.
- College Education/School of Hard Knocks/Linguist and Jack of All Trades work properly for knowledge skills during character creation. Again.
- Most of the functionality for Infected has been implemented. Todo: Fix up the free attribute gain to not use qualities because it's ugly, and put in the data files content.
- N of M contact points in priority build works again.
- Fixed an issue where chummer failed to open when clicking on a .chum5 file.
- Implemented functionality for the quality "Friends in High Places".
- Save/Load methods for Advanced Lifestyles should actually work properly now, but it's still a bit fragile. Bugs are to be expected, particularly if you change your mind a lot.
- Most issues with adepts getting levels of powers from multiple sources should be resolved. (Mentor Spirits, Foci, etc.)
- Rounding issue for Recoil Compensation from Strength resolved.
- Variable costs for Qualities enabled to support the Rank quality. May eventually lead into redoing the way Qualities with multiple ratings work, because High Pain Tolerance (Rating 6) offends me every time I scroll past it.

Data Change:
- Organising data file contents into regions to keep things easy to work with.
- Rank Quality added.
- The Debug Lifestyle has been hidden.
- Lifemodules no longer contains a "Magical Education (Archetype)".
- Tír is now spelled correctly a few more places.
- Equipment, Weapon and Ammo PACKs from run faster added.
    There are a couple of important caveats with this:
    First, we generally haven't bothered to input PACKs that are a single item. If someone would like to write them up then that's fine, but there's only so many hours of data entry one can do.
    Second, items that don't currently exist haven't been added in, like backpacks. Again, mostly a tedium thing but the PACKs code doesn't play nice with Custom Item and I don't like littering up the data files with fluff items.
      Items not added include:
      - Backpack.
      - Sound-link on the earbuds.
      - Disposable inhaler from Cheap Soldier Pack.
      - Orange vest from Sportsman Pack.
      - Reusable Syringe from Tranq Darter Pack and Tranq Pistol Darter Pack.
      - Bug-out bag's dufflebag.
      - Mechanic Shop's duct-tape.
      - Surveillance pack's Periscope.
      - Infiltration Kit contains a Micro-Transceiver on the assumption that that's the correct item.
      - Medium Machine gunner pack doesn't contain ammo belts, but does come with the ammo.
  - Ammo packs not added as stacks split among multiple types of weapons is not possible in Chummer5a.
  - Rigger Pack gets Reaction Enhancers instead of the mythical reflex enhancers. Come on guys, it's a list of items. Seriously, if you need an editor I'm sure there's tons of people who'd be happy to sign an NDA.
  - Big Boom Pistoleer pack has 190 rounds of heavy regular amunition, because Chummer doesn't care about your brass.
  - Most lifestyles ignored, per the 'we can't be bothered adding single items' policy mentioned above.
  - Gunbunny pack not added as it contains unattached accessories, which Chummer doesn't currently like handling. To be added in a future patch.
  - Some custom packs added from reddit's shadowrun comunitieswith permission from /u/NotB0b and ShadowNET SysOp.
  - Fixed an issue with the Extreme Cyberimplant and Junkyard Jaw from Chrome Flesh.
  - Pulse Weave costs Rating * 3000.

New strings:
- Message_HighContact
- Checkbox_Options_Missions

Build 172:
Application Change:
- Due to the return of Move-By-Wire, Initiative is no longer capped to your REA+INT's augmented maximum.
- Fixed an issue with lifestyle quality costs that caused a crash on print.
- The cap for Qualities is now based on your Gameplay Option. For example, a Prime Runner can spend up to 35 Karma on Positive qualities, and gain 35 from Negative qualities.
- Compability mode added. Chummer should now **run** on .NET 4.0, but some stuff might not work, and we (the Chummer5a team) won't provide support.
- Fixed a bug where advanced (and normal?) lifestyles would crash on other languages
- More specific spirit data is available for charsheets to use.
- Chummer now has a crash reporter. If Chummer encounters an error it can't recover from, it will (if given permision) send a data package (hopefully) identifying the source of the crash.
- Chummer now won't pretend you have 25 BP in SumToTen/Priority build modes
- Fixed edge case where Sum To Ten would ask for a karma amount like Karma/Life Module builds
- Prime Data Haven now automatically creates/removes an appropriate 5C/3L contact.
- Cyberware can now add qualities. Not particularly happy with the implementation, but it works.
- Cyberware can have a metatype restriction.
- Born Rich quality works properly.
- The Select Bioware/Cyberware form can now display a special notes text field to indicate weird workaroundy stuff that I can't be bothered fixing with code.
    - For example, Striking Calluses are treated as a Rating item, with the Notes field explaining why. Currently has no support for translations.
- Essence Discount house rule enabled. Can be used to emulate the Prototype Transhuman quality for you munchkin mages that need your pain editors and whatnot until I get around to implementing it properly.
- Fixed an issue with the incorrect cap being used for spell selection. There's still a couple of UI failures that need to be resolved, but they're a relatively low priority.

Data Change:
- The Water Sprite quality confers +2 to Diving and Swimming, instead of prompting you to select one of them.
- Machine Pistols were missing a few accessory slots; they can now mount stocks and such.
- Cyberware Holdout Pistol typo fixed.
- Gameplay Options have been moved into their own XML file, gameplayoptions.xml.
- Added the missing qualities "Poor Self Control (Sadistic)" and "Poor Self Control (Attention-Seeking)"
- Lifestyles.xml GUIDs populated to support the language fix.
- Adapsin bioware properly discounts cyberware costs.
- Fire Modes for the Colt Inception have been fixed.
- Metatype Reduction has been added. Due to the differing benefits, it is split up into two different items for Orks and Trolls, respectively.
- Troll Reduction has been added.
- Assorted bits of cosmetic bioware and bio-weapons from Chrome Flesh have been added.
- Life Modules have been added from all existing source books, courtesy of joha4270 and angelforest. Functionality is complete-ish, but there are some awkward modules in Further Education and such that may not quite work as expected. Feedback and suggestions for this is greatly appreciated.
- Fixed an issue that stopped Aspected Magicians from gaining access to the Spells and Spirits tab. Replace-all is nobody's friend.

String Changes:
Altered:
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedNegativeQualitiesLimit
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedPositiveQualities
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedNegativeQualities
- Message_SpellLimit

New:
- MessageBox_NoValidContactFound

Build 171:
Application Change:
- Fixed an issue with Priority characters not loading properly. Malformed XML file.

Data Change:
- Accuracy for the Cougar Fine Blades altered.
- Chakram weapon added.
- The PPSK-4 has had a Collapsed Frame accessory added to it that confers -6 Concealability to represent the collapsible box thing you can put it in. Accessory mods can also no longer be installed on the gun.
- Blowgun range changed.
- Sound suppressor added to the Barret.
- Missing Ammo from Run and Gun added.
- Skilljacks and Skillwires have had their costs adjusted to match Chrome Flesh values, because apparently errata isn't a thing that's done these days.
- Wireless Skillsoft Networks have been added as Lifestyle Qualities. Yes, Advanced Lifestyles are still a little broken. It's on the list.

IMPORTANT NOTE:.NET 4.5.1 IS CURRENTLY A REQUIRED COMPONENT. CHUMMER WILL CRASH ON VERSIONS BELOW 4.5.1.

Build 170:
Application Change:
- Metasapient cost is properly counted in Sum to Ten and Priority.
- Fixed an issue with the default Free Contact Multiplier value. Existing installations may still have a Contact Multiplier value of 1. To fix this, open Tools > Options > House Rules and enable/disable the "Free Contact Points equal to Charisma times X" rule.
- Fixed an issue with the Critical Strike power that caused a crash, due to the name being changed.
- Jack of All Trades shows the proper tooltip value.
- Variable Sum to X character creation enabled. Changing Build Methods still doesn't work quite right, so it's recommended to make a new character if you want to do this.
- Genemods and Symbionts are locked to Standard grade properly.
- Internal changes to how some values are stored. Shouldn't affect characters.
- Added support for building characters with Life Modules.
    | If a character has multiple knowledge skills with the same name, they can optionally be folded in to one another by clicking the Collapse button on the right side of the skill.
    | Only debug life modules have been created thus far; any assistance in writing up the data for this would be greatly appreciated.
    | Selecting Life Modules will pre-generate a Background for your character. This can still be edited normally, but makes for a useful springboard. Development is still in the early stages, but is more or less functional. Full thanks to joha4270 for implementing this.

Data Change:
- Priviliged Family Name's SIN requirement changed to National or Corporate, rather than Corporate (Limited).
- Ambidextrous quality is now enabled for multiple limbs. Shine on, you crazy Indian diamonds.
- Dragonslayer Mentor Spirit fixed to give +2 to Combat Spells instead of Detection.
- Fixed a missing value for the Linguist property that was preventing its bonus from working.
- Casemods can be removed from Cyberware.
- Living Focus and Keratin Control have been added to the Street Grimoire book. The Shadowrun Forum Post 1 book has been removed.

Build 169:
Application Change:
- Fixed an issue with skill and karma values defaulting to 0 in character creation.
- Fiddled with Auto-update a bit, might work better. Please test and advise.

Data Change:
- New book: Chrome Flesh.
- Content for Chrome Flesh added. Data provided courtesy of Fweeba.

Build 168:
Application Change:
- Did some stuff to make spell descriptors show up in character sheets.
- Karma carry-over for build methods other than Point Buy fixed to 7. You may need to reset your options to defaults for this to take effect. Tools > Options > Karma Costs.
- Fixed an issue with skills changing their values incorrectly.
- Fixed an issue with discounts for knowledge skills not working properly.

Data Change:
- Fixed a fault with the calculation of Net ranges that caused a crash.
- Data Trails content added. Some additional functionality for commlink dongles and such is still required, so they haven't been included yet. Much thanks to Iridios for his work with this.

Build 167:
New collaborator on the project acquired! joha4270 has been assisting with a variety of issues, and is currently tackling the implementation of Life Modules, along with several other tricky problems. Huzzah!

Application Change:
- Changes made to the Contact controls; most features of a contact are now only visible on hover. Makes things a bit neater. Looking for feedback on implementation of this. Good? Not good?
- Support for free contacts enabled.
- Support for group contacts from Run Faster implemented.
- Support for the Made Man quality from Run Faster implemented.
- Karma and Nuyen graphs now scale with time.
- Fixed a bug with calculation of Street Cred.
- Fixed a bug with Nuyen and Karma graphs being in order of addition instead of date. Also makes neat plateus and valleys.
- Fixed an issue in which the Maximum Modified Rating rule could not be disabled.
- Fixed issues with Limit Enhancements not saving.
- Technical School, College Education, Linguist qualities do the discounty things they're supposed to.
- Fixed issues with the optional rule to re-group skill groups if the skills were balanced when the character was saved.
- Fixed an embarassing issue with broken skill groups levelling themselves back down to the grouped rating.
- Fixed the behaviour of Custom Fit so that it only counts if the Custom Fitted item is also equipped. Not super happy with the code, but I'm also tired of looking at it, so eh.
- Undocumented inherited feature of the day: the <armoroverride> key supports Custom Fit. If an item with the Custom Fit (Stack) mod is equipped, and has an Extra value that matches another equipped piece of armour, the armour value of the item will be changed to the override value.
- Character creation validation now checks for Betaware/Deltaware and stops you from having nice things.
- Firemodes now work properly for languages other than English. (Original code didn't expect that someone would actually change the string for the firemode abbreviations, so kudos to you, random German guy who translated everything!)
- Made some alterations to the appearance and function of contacts. Outstanding issues: Made Man and karma costs don't update properly.

Data Change:
- Fixed a big with Colt Agent Special not using Heavy Pistol ammunition.
- Fixed incorrect calculation for varieties of Indomitable.
- Hanuman name fixed again. Frankly CGL should take the initiative of spelling the name correctly, for I am incapable of spelling errors.
- Enhanced Articulation no longer prompts for the skill bonus.
- Keen-eared and Balance Receptor are properly marked as Metagenetic qualities.
- Digital Doppelganger now prompts for a text entry, and requires that you be a SINner.

Build 166
Application Change:

- Values for Contact and Knowledge Multipliers will now reset to their default values if the relevant house rules are disabled.
- Value for Contact and Knowledge Multipliers reset to proper defaults.
- Fixed several magic traditions to use valid spirit names. 'Spirit of Plant'. Pfft.
- Fixed an issue with Spirit Bane being available to non-magic users.
- Fixed an issue that enabled the free knowledge skills for point buy if the free contact point house rule was enabled.

Build 165
Application Change:
- Knowledge skills actually fixed now. Is now completely buildmethod-agnostic, so won't break when you look at it funny.

Data Change:
- Fixed an issue with Hanuman in Sum-to-Ten/Priority.

Build 164
Application Change:
- Martial Arts are no longer included in the calculations for positive quality limits at chargen.
- Fixed an issue in which point-buy characters weren't having points removed after patch 162.
- Fixed an issue with characters that had Middle/Medium lifestyles causing a crash.
- Fixed a number of stupid errors with knowledge skill and contact calculation. Knowledge skills still need an errata to confirm whether/how they're supposed to interact with karma and free points in point buym but should otherwise work correctly.
- House rules enabled to provide for a different contact and knowledge skill multiplier.
- House rules to override quality limits without otherwise breaking chargen rules enabled.

Data Change:
- Fixed an incorrect Category for the Obscure/Difficult to Find lifestyle quality.
- Nitama Sportier uses heavy pistol ranges.

New Strings:
- Checkbox_Options_ContactMultiplier
- Checkbox_Options_KnowledgeMultiplier

- Changelog.txt, Manifestdata.xml and manifestlang.xml added to the Admin folder. Not included in the client files; used for pushing automatic updates.

Build 163
Administrative Change:
- Controls (Skills, groups, etc.) moved into a separate folder because I'm tired of looking for them and can't be bothered prefixing. Organisation is love. Organisation is life.

Application Change:
- AUTOMATIC UPDATES ENABLED. Now I just have to not forget to update the version metadata every time I fiddle with something...
    - To use automatic updates, open the Tools window and click on Check For Updates. Any new file versions should be available for download. Select the files, hit the download button and cross your fingers.
- Fix for Friends in High Places causing a crash due to invalid bounds.
- Fixed an issue with free karma knowledge reverting values to 0.
- Rewrite of Knowledge Skill BP calculation to support free points. Needs some logic validation.
- Fixed an issue with the Blind (Mage) quality causing an exception.
- Added functionality for the Jack of All Trades, Master of None quality.
- Added functionality for the College Education quality from Run Faster.

Data Change:
- Updated some spells with correct ranges, from the errata.
- Updated some martial arts, courtesy of Urs Zeidler.

Build 162
Application Change:
- Points for free Contacts include Karma values.
- Amended an issue where the first point of Connection or Loyalty was free for Contacts. Basing this off the example text on page 99, but I'm moderately sure that there was a falling out between the development team and the writers at some point, so they may not have been talking at that point.
- Added an optional rule to generate free contacts during Point Buy. Currently working on adding free contact points during Point Buy. Shouldn't be much longer to complete.
- Refixed an issue with skill groups adding points to the Priority number counters.  Will also clean up karmagen characters that were built accidentally using Points instead of just Karma.
- Fixed issues with the Uneducated, Infirm, and Uncouth qualities during chargen. (Additional karma costs, wrong karma costs, just generally broken.)
- Support added for the School of Hard Knocks quality.
- Build Summary now reports the Karma used by Contacts if you exceed the free points.

Data Change:
- Blind (Mage) quality is now available for Adepts that have the Astral Perception quality.

New Strings:
- String_OverContactPoints

Build 161 (Reverting things that weren't broken Hotfix)
Application Change:
- So it turns out that the default options don't actually populate from where they're defined, but are an entirely separate int. Todo: buy scotch. Try not to cry. Cry deeply.
- Fixed the issue with skills doubling their rating on load. Commenting out code without explaining why you did it is dangerous, kiddies. Don't uncomment things you don't know the purpose of.

Build 160
Application Change:
- When using Point Buy, karma can no longer be carried over into Career Mode, because Point Buy cannot have nice things.
- Sum to Ten now validates over/under limits.
- Nuyen cost for Martial Arts and styles removed, because I'm an idiot and didn't pay attention to what Instruction Cost meant.
- Revalidated default karma options again, default value for contacts changed.
- Added a prompt to close open characters when changing Options. Will look at this again properly later to support saving the characters and reloading them, but for now it just closes, prompting the user to save any modified characters.
- Did some fiddling with the UI for Point Buy and the optional 'Free Knowledge Skills like Priority' rule. Buy With Karma is enabled by default, etc.

- Default state of the rule "Allow broken skillgroups to be regrouped if they have an equal value." changed to enabled.
- Improvements generated by Foci binding (Improved Physical Attribute, for example) are now removed when a Focus is unbound. Should fix edge cases that were effected in a similar manner.
- Negative Metavariant karma points count towards the Negative Quality limit. (Ie, a priority C hobgoblin can only take 20 Karma worth of Negative Qualities.)
- Limited support for using web-browsers (Chrome, Firefox) as your PDF application added. IE doesn't work, and I'm not interested in figuring out why.
- Power Point limits are re-calculated when Karma values are changed.
- Essence Loss during Karmagen correctly pulls from Karma.
- PACKs validated for functionality. They should work, but TERRIBLE HORRIBLE CRASHES WILL HAPPEN IF A PACK INCLUDES AN ITEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. The default set of PACKs will be created in the near future.
- Advanced Lifestyles are enabled in creation mode. Basic lifestyles have currently been disabled, because I am lazy and haven't remade it. I've only done limited testing with this, so please report any issues that you come across.

Data Change:
- Technomancer, Adept, Mystic Adept, Magician, Aspected Magician and Changeling qualities no longer contribute towards quality limit during karmagen.

Build 5.157
Application Change:
- Karma calculation issue fixed in karmagen for special attributes. (Sure, let's include a specific handler for priority gen and nothing else. Makes sense.)

Data Change:
- Metavariant/Metasapient BP costs and karma values shifted into Priorities/SumtoTen.xml files because Hobgoblins are terrible.

Issues:
- Metavariants that confer bonus karma (Hobgoblin, Oni at Priority C) currently are not counted against the maximum limit for Negative Qualities.

Build 5.155

- Metasapients partially added. (They're in, but prices are largely incorrect)

Build 5.154
Application Change:
- Change Metatype/Priority Selection special menu fixed to remove and disable Special attributes if you no longer have the relevant Talent. Needs some extra things done later to clean it up, but it works.
- Fixed a Nuyen calculation issue that stopped starting nuyen from being included.
Data Change:
- Restored a fix to Elf metavariants that caused a crash.
- Settings.xml will no longer be published in builds, to prevent issues with debugging data.

Build 5.153.2
Application Change:

- Removed needless, broken validation that stopped karma-nuyen conversion from working in priority/sum-to-ten builds.

Build 5.153.1

Data changes:

- Submersion fixed; Echoes are now purchasable.

Build 5.140
- Fixed the tooltip showing the karma values for raising magic in career mode.

Build 5.139
- Added in the ability to multi-specialize in skills post character creation.
- Updated Mnemonic Enhancer to provide its bonus to the Mental Limit and Memory Tests.
- Updated Tailored Pheromones to provide a flat bonus to the social limit instead of a limit modifier.
- Fixed a bug with Qi Foci that could prevent it from showing the power it provides in the bound foci list.
- Updated Martial Arts so that it prevents taking the same Technique via the same Martial Art so you can have stacked bonuses.
- Fixed the Advanced Safety System from Run and Gun so that it would be available for use.
- Added the new spirits from Spirit Grimoire to the specialization lists for each of the Summoning skils.

Build 5.138 (beta)
- Fixed the spelling on the name of the Evo Armadillo Armored Spacesuit.
- Fixed the calculation of the Mortimer of London coats when dealing with unequipped armor.
- Updated Chem Seal and Environmental Adaptation for Full Body Armor to be mods for Full Body Armor rather than armors themselves.
- For the Translator: Fixed both the Page and Translated columns so that they correctly save changes.

Build 5.137 (beta)
- Before anything else, I want to thank Geg (chummer5de@gmail.com) for going above and beyond working on the German translation for Chummer. A very large part of Chummer's data files have been translated into German by Geg over the last week and I cannot thank him enough for taking it upon himself to do this.
- In order to resolve differences between the English and German printings, I've added a new book entitled "Shadowrun 5th Edition (German)".  I've attached to this book the German versions of the Raven Mentor Spirit and Skilljack Cyberware.  This should allow German players to use the versions printed in their books and other players to use them if their group is treating those rules as errata to the English book.
- Updated Contacts by splitting the Name field into three fields: Name, Location, and Archetype. The dropdown has been moved to Archetype. Any existing Contacts will show any existing info under Name.  The character sheets have been updated to show the new Contact fields.
- Updated the Ultimax Rain Forest Carbine to use the updated stats provided in the Missions FAQ Update version 1.1.1.
- Removed the Restrictive quality from SWAT Armor that was there in error.
- Fixed a bad tooltip for the Cyberlegs house rule.

- Fixed the price of the Armanté Suit and Dress.
- Fixed a formatting problem with the skills list so that the list should now scroll properly.
- Fixed a bug preventing leftover nuyen from being carried over after character creation.

- Added the Custom Tradition to Career mode.
- Fixed the Drain Resist dice pool for limited spells.
- Fixed the armor calculation for stacking armor including occasionally stacking items like the Mortimer's High-Fashion armor.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent adding the free adept powers granted by a mentor spirit if in Career mode.

Build 5.136 (beta)
- Due to popular request, Enemies are back again. These are not part of 5th Edition (at least not yet) so using them is a house rule.
- The Contacts/Enemies UI has been updated to use tabs rather than being stacked.  This gives a little more room for both contacts and enemies.
- Contacts now show a dropdown list for the name allowing you to enter your own contact information or select one from a list. As of yet, Enemies have no options in the list but this will be added at a later date (suggestions welcome).
- Added logging to the update function. Hopefully this will be helpful in tracking down issues when downloading updates.
- Removed a possible bug that could cause the update to go into a loop.
- Added a new Buy With Karma checkbox to each of the Active and Knowledge skills in Creation mode that allows you to buy the specialization with karma instead of skill points.
- Added tooltips to the house rules on the options dialog to help explain which each house rule does.
- Added a house rule to the Options dialog that will allow Initiation and Submersion during Create mode.
- As it was pointed out to me that I missed the sentence on page 66 that explicitly allows spending Attribute Points on the bonus point granted by Exceptional Attribute or Lucky, I've removed the house rules relating to Exceptional Attribute and am now following the rules as specified.  Sorry for any confusion.

Build 5.135 (beta)
- Minor fix to enable downloading the translator app via Chummer update.

Build 5.134 (beta)
- Now includes a translator application (Translator.exe).  This app allows you to create and edit the language files to translate Chummer into non-English languages.  If you're interested in doing a translation for distribution with Chummer, please let me know via srchummer5@gmail.com and we'll make arrangements for you to send me updated language files.  This is the first release of this translator app so please let me know if you run into problems using it. There's a bit more to come for handling translation, this was just the first big step.
- To resolve an issue with Exotic weapon skills, special weapons were moved into the appropriate Exotic weapon category.
- Fixed a bug that could cause Adept Power Points to be miscalculated in Career mode when adding cyber/bioware.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when printing your character.
- Removed the Enemies section as this was a leftover from 4th Edition.
- Removed the duplicate Narcoject entry.
- Added the low-light and infrared flashlights from the core book.

Build 5.133 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when adding adept powers.

Build 5.132 (beta)
- Added a House Rule "Use Skill Points on broken groups" that allows you to spend Active Skill Points in Creation mode on skills belonging to broken skill groups.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent raising Edge, Magic, or Resonance to maximum.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash if a skill group was raised which included a skill that had free levels.
- Fixed the page numbers for a handful of Illusion Spells.
- Removed a duplicate entry for Gamma-Scopolamine.

- Fixed a bug causing new spirits added in Create mode being added by a Mystic Adept to have the wrong Force value.
- Fixed a spelling error on the Shadowrun Forum Post 1.
- Added Advanced Medkits from Bullets & Bandages.  No availability is listed for Advanced Medkits in B&B so I just used the availability for standard Medkits.
- Updated the validation warning message concerning having gear over capacity so that it now specifies exactly which items are over capacity.
- Fixed a bug that would throw up a validation error on characters using Prime Runner stats that have more than 25 karma in positive or negative qualities.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Prime Runners from converting to Career mode.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the character load to fail if it was a Prime Runner with more than 10 karma spent on nuyen.
- Updated the Missile Mastery Adept Power to include the +1DV and +1 Dice on Thrown Weapons.  Not sure this is the correct fix though as this is only supposed to apply to non-explosive thrown weapons.
- Fixed a bug allowing purchase of more levels than should be allowed on Flexibility, Stillness, and Penetrating Strike.  This fix will only apply on powers added after this update.
- Fixed a bug with the Ares Giantslayer Slingshot that was causing a crash when selecting it.

Build 5.131 (beta)
A quick shout out... I had programming help on this build from a friend of mine named Ed.  Thank you Ed!

- Completely rebuilt how karma is spent on Attributes, Special Attributes, Skill Groups, Active Skills, and Knowledge Skills to reflect the RAW on the steps in character creation. All existing characters should load up just fine but karma costs may have changed to reflect applying the RAW. Each of these now have separate entry boxes for applying points from your Priority selection and for buying up with Karma. Validation now checks to see if you've overspent on your points.  I believe I've been able to correctly handle the steps as written while giving a UI that allows you to treat it as a single step (rather than going through a gateway similar to "Mark as Created").  The only thing I haven't updated as part of this is whether skill specialization is paid for with skill points or karma... at this time it automatically uses skill points to pay for skill specialization but I'll update this in a future enhancement when I will also tackle being able to have multiple specializations per skill.  There are two new house rules to allow you to tailor how these rules are applied to some degree. If others are needed, send along a request and I'll take a look.
- Added custom Traditions. If you select the Custom Tradition from the dropdown, it will enable additional fields for you to provide your tradition name, select your drain attributes, and select your spirits for each school.  This information is saved with the character and is portable with it.
- Fixed the skill bonus from the Cat Mentor Spirit so that it will apply to Sneaking (the English core book says Infiltration on page 321).
- Spell dice pools should now pull from the correct skill (Spellcasting, Ritual Spellcasting, Alchemy, Artificing) for each spell.
- Corrected the drain value for the Resist Pain Spell.
- Fixed the values on the Build Summary tab for Spells, Complex Forms, and Contacts which under some conditions might show the wrong value.
- Fixed the Armor value on the Condition Monitor tab in Career Mode to show the correct value.
- Added the armor encumberance rule from page 169 so that it applies to armor accessories such as helmets and shields.
- Removed the duplicate Astral Powder gear entry.
- Fixed the missing availability and price for Fetishes.
- Clicking on a blank area within the Contacts, Skill Groups, Active Skills, or Knowledge Skills regions will allow you to scroll them with the scroll wheel.
- Removed the tooltips that were showing the wrong text on the labels on the Limits tab.
- Added a house rule to allow paying only the standard cost for Qualities in Career Mode instead of double as per RAW.
- Removed the option to buy a vehicle used as this was from 4th Edition and has not been carried over into 5th.

Build 5.130 (beta)
- Removed some duplicate specialties from the Politics Knowledge Skill.
- Made the Adept Way Qualities not available for non-adepts.
- Added the Astral Limit to the Limits tab and the character sheets.  Keep in mind that limit modifiers to either your mental limit or social limit that can apply in the astral might conditionally apply to your astral limit during play.
- Fixed Enhanced Articulation Bioware so that it applies the correct skill bonuses.
- Fixed several issues surrounding full Cyberlimbs. Attribute averaging has been removed as it was a 4th Edition rule. The limb on the character sheet now shows the limb's total Strength, Agility, and its Physical Limit.
- Movement rate now uses the augmented Agility value.
- Added an option under House Rules to use derived Attributes from Cyberlegs when calculating movement speed.
- Added all that lovely Qi Foci code from build 5.129 to Career Mode as well. Completely missed that one.
- Now correctly charges double for positive qualities added or negative qualities deleted after character creation.
- When selecting YNT Softweave in the Select Armor Mod dialog, it will now show "+50%" in the capacity field.
- Removed the button in Career mode that allowed adding more Mystic Adept Power Points. You're not actually allowed to add points this way after character creation.
- Added Custom Ballistic Mask.
- Added the specialized silencer for the Ares Light Fire 75 and added it to the Ares Light Fire 75.
- Added some very minor fixes for the underbarrel weapons from Run and Gun so at least they won't cause a crash.  They still don't behave the way I want them to though so I'll be revisiting this "soon".

Build 5.129 (beta)
- Qi Foci will now ask what power they're providing when you bind the foci and that power will now show up on your list of powers with the appropriate free levels if any and the name of the Qi Foci will be updated to show the power it is providing.  For Improved Reflexes, select the level you want your character to have and the foci rating, it will reduce the power point cost accordingly.
- Fixed a bug preventing weapons from being added to Heavy Weapon Mounts.
- Updated firearms that come stock with a Smartgun System to have the internal version.
- Added the Gas-Vent 2 System that the Ares Crusader II should have.
- Fixed the AP on the Colt M23.
- Manabolt is now correctly a Mana based spell.

Build 5.128 (beta)
- First and foremost, recent builds (including this one) have been getting updates to the French translation files courtesy of Lous_59. Thank you for your amazing work!
- Fixed a bug preventing loading bows or crossbows with ammunition in Career mode.
- Cleaned up the former Commlinks section on the Character Sheet.  It now is the Device section and each Commlink, RCC, or Cyberdeck shows itself as such.  Fixed a few problem items that were showing their stats incorrectly.
- Added device stat labels to cyberware, armor, weapon, gear, and vehicle tabs so that you can see the stats for selected commlinks, cyberdecks, or rigger command consoles.
- For newly created characters only, limit modifiers will now inlcude the condition under which they operate.  I'd make this retroactive but it would be a nightmare to code.
- Fixed the Quality Indomitable and the Adept Power Improved Potential to add directly to the calculated limits rather than add limit modifiers as these bonuses apply at all times.  This also resolved the issue with the Chaos Mentor Spirit where it was not applying the bonus from the granted Improved Potential power.
- Fixed a bug where in some cases carry-over karma from character creation would not be carried over.
- Will now automatically remove the Allergy when removing the Eagle Mentor Spirit.
- Fixed the Initiation/Submersion tab so that it will allow adding multiple instances of metamagics and echoes that allow it.
- Updated the Infusion of [Matrix Attribute] and Defusion of [Matrix Attribute] so that they will ask for you to enter the name of the attribute being adjusted.  For now it is a text entry, at some later date it may become a drop down.
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the karma calculation when increasing skills belonging to a broken skill group in creation mode.
- Updated the Select a Mentor Spirit dialog to not show choices you're not eligible for.  So Magician options won't show up for Adepts and Adept options won't show up for Magicians.  Mystic Adepts still see all options.

Build 5.127 (beta)
- Fixed a bug where it was not rounding Essence up when calculating your Social Limit.
- Fixed a bug which would prevent adding Sensor Functions to Sensors.
- Fixed a bug which would prevent any metamagics from being shown when selecting a new metamagic.

Build 5.126 (beta)
- Completely replaced the Initiation tab. It now should correctly handle Initiation (with discounts), Arts, Enchantments, Enhancements, Metamagics, and Rituals. Add an Initiation grade and then right click on the grade to add Arts, Enchantments, Enhancements, Metamagics, and Rituals.  In case you're not using Street Grimoire or choose not to use the Arts system, there is a new item on the House Rules tab of the Options dialog that you can use to ignore the Art requirements for metamagics and the like.
- Fixing the above item led to two powers referenced in Street Grimoire that haven't previously been published.  These have only been provided via a forum post by one of the designers.  So that post is now a source (SFP1) that can be enabled in order to provide those powers (Keratin Control and Living Focus).
- Updated all "Source" labels on all dialogs to open the linked PDF to that page if you have linked the book to the PDF in the Options dialog.  Also linked the names of skills and powers as they don't show a "Source" label in their listings.  And finally, the above mentioned forum post will open in your default browser if a Source pointing to it is clicked.
- Added the Small Unit Tactics Knowledge Skill from Run and Gun.
- Fixed a bug allowing the Seducer's Adept ability to allow any skill. It now restricts to the correct list. Thank you Ariketh for the solution!
- Fixed the Voice Control Adept power to allow for multiple levels.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when using YNT Softweave on an armor with an odd armor value.
- Added a variable price to Personalized Grip to reflect that it probably should cost something.
- Removed cyber-weapons from the Select a Weapon dialog. These can only be purchased now on the Select Cyberware dialog.
- Fixed a bug preventing the Respirator from being available to add to armor.
- Fixed a bug causing newly added Knowledge Skills to cap at 6 in career mode.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the tooltip on the button to increase your skill level to show the wrong value when in career mode and at rating 6.
- Fixed a bug that prevented adding Sensor Arrays (and quite a few other things) to vehicles while in Career mode.
- Adjusted the Select Weapon and Select Armor dialogs so that they'll have better performance.
- Fixed the price of the Monofilament Chainsaw.
- Fixed a multitude of bugs with the Complex Forms and Sprites tab in Career mode for Technomancers.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the wrong cost to be calculated for binding Counterspelling, Ritual Spellcasting, Spellcasting, or Sustaining Foci in Career mode.

Build 5.125 (beta)
- Fixed Damage and AP value for EXplosive Ammo
- Fixed a bug which would prevent the Dragonslayer Mentor Spirit from getting the bonus to a social skill.
- Added a separator between gear items attached to armor on the "Shadowrun 5" character sheets.
- Fixed a bug preventing refunding of Complex Form points when deleting a Complex Form.
- Weapons will now correctly inherit availability modifiers from accessories which should increase the weapon's availability.
- Removed 4th Edition artifact where Improved Physical Attribute was charging double for attributes raised above metatype max.
- Fixed a bug which could cause the movement formula to give incorrect values (it wasn't using the total value including augmentations).

Build 5.124 (beta)
- Fixed the crash non-US users were having when adding a Mentor Spirit.

Build 5.123 (beta)
- Fixed Security Armor: Heavy's armor rating.
- Added debug logging. By default this is turned off for performance reasons but if you encounter a significant error, I may ask you to turn it on so that the error can be captured and logged which will make my fixing the problem much easier.  If you do need to turn it on, you'll find it on the Options dialog listed as "Use Debug Logging".  For space reasons, if the log is turned on it will automatically clear itself each time you start Chummer.  At this time, only a small portion of Chummer's code is set up for debug logging but I'll be expanding this as I can.

Build 5.122 (beta)
- Fixed a number of bugs relating to Mentor Spirits and as best as I can tell, they're all working as intended. If you find otherwise, please email me a copy of your character sheet with a brief explanation of what's going wrong.
- Mountain Mentor Spirit now provides its bonus to Counterspelling
- Doom Mentor Spirit now correctly provides a +2 to the combat skill of your choice if you choose that option.
- Mutation Mentor Spirit now correctly asks for which ability to apply Attribute Boost.
- Eagle Mentor Spirit now automatically applies "Polutants" as the trigger of your Allergy.
- Dog Mentor Spirit now asks which senses are being improved.
- Moved the Smartgun System on the Savalette Guardian to be Internal.

Build 5.121 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that was preventing purchase of Binoculars (both digital and optical).
- Fixed a bug that was causing a soft crash when clicking on a weapon accessory.

Build 5.120 (beta)
- Updated the counters on the Build Summary tab to go into negative values if you use karma to overspend.  So if you have 3 contact points and add a 2/2 contact, it'll show "-1 of 3".
- Replaced the karma calculation for over-spending on Knowledge Skills. In short, the old mechanism was what was built in original Chummer and made you pay for the most expensive Knowledge Skill point from any of your Knowledge Skills when you went over. The new mechanism works just as the Active Skills (and Attributes) does meaning it looks for the cheapest possible option.  So if you had four points of Knowledge skills available and put 4 in skill A and 1 in skill B, the old method would charge you for raising skill A from 3 to 4 while the new method charges you to raise skill B to 1 (figuring out that the cheapest method is to put those four free points in skill A and pay karma for B).  This means that if you have an existing character still in character creation mode that spent karma on Knowledge Skills, you'll likely get some karma back.
- Fixed a bug that was incorrectly calculating your spent contact points.
- Fixing an issue with auto-update. I think this will stabilize auto-update and handle broken downloads better but I won't know for sure until we try.
- Fixed the price of the Redundant Power Supply.
- Changed Ares Predator V from External to Internal Smartgun System. This change will only apply on newly purchased Predators.

Build 5.119 (beta)
- Added Alchemical Preparations.
- Fixed a bug causing a crash when using Weapon Commlinks and Commlink Accessories.
- Fixed a bug that would improperly load adept powers if the character has more than one instance of that power.
- Fixed a bug with the Wolf Mentor Spirit that would cause a crash when selecting the Adept power.
- Fixed the capacity cost of Trodes.
- Fixed a bug that would excessively reduce the attribute minimum for Magic or Resonance when taking on an Essence reduction. This would cause Chummer to attempt to raise the attribute back to where it was by spending karma if need be.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Hand Blades from being available for purchase.
- Added a few more license options (based on Third Edition SR with the help of SpellBinder).
- Fixed a bug with audio enhancements (specifically the Audio Enhancement and Select Sound Filter) that weren't consuming capacity.

Build 5.118 (beta)
- Auto-update is back! For builds after 5.118 you'll be able to use the auto-update and check for update functionality to get new builds.
- Really fixed the Awaken spell so that it only appears once and has the correct book and page. Honestly, I got it this time!
- Removed the alternate Leadership and Arcana skills from 4th Edition.
- Fixed the weapon mounts on the Ares Duelist drone.
- Resolved the error on the Options dialog by setting the Shadowrun 5 sheet as the default if one isn't present.
- Adept powers will now sort by name when you load the character.
- Updated vehicles to allow adding any gear. This resolves several issues... First, being able to replace the standard sensors. Second, until we have vehicle capacity rules, there's really no programmatic means to say what does and does not belong in a car.

Build 5.117 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that could cause a bug while browsing weapons.

Build 5.116 (beta)
- Updated how Limit Modifiers work. In short, there are now two kinds. First, there's those provided by a specific source... for example the Indomitable quality. When you add the quality to or remove the quality from your character, it will automatically add or remove the limit modifier for you. Second, there's custom modifiers. These you add and remove yourself from the Limits tab.  I'm leaving this in place because there's always going to be some limit modifier I've left off and this gives one handy place to view and adjust your modifiers.  Unfortunately this does mean that limit modifiers on existing characters are going to be a problem.  You can however delete the existing limit modifiers, and then remove and re-add the items, qualities, powers, and so on that provide limit modifiers and this will add them back in correctly.
- Added a new Browse feature to the select Weapons and Armor dialogs. In the upper right corner of the dialog, there's a button marked "Browse". If you click it, you'll be shown a grid showing the items belonging to the selected category. You can sort the grid by clicking on the column headers. Otherwise it works the same as the list and you can switch back and forth as you like.
- Added a new Custom Item in Gear under the Custom category.  This item will ask you for a name and a price. You will be charged the amount you specify and the item will take on the name you give it, showing in your inventory as that name.  This should allow for any odd custom or table/campaign specifc item you may need.
- Added the content from Sail Away, Sweet Sister (SASS).
- Added the content from Stolen Souls (SS).
- Added the option to create Prime Runner and Street Level characters.
- Fixed the Demolitions bonus to the Doom mentor spirit.
- Updated the Exceptional Attribute quality to allow selection of Magic and Resonance.
- Fixed the availability calculation for Alpha/Beta/Deltaware for certain pieces of cyber and bioware.
- Removed the Throwing Weapons category from the Select Weapon dialog because these are all purchased as Gear.
- Added priority selection to the Text-Only character sheet.  This information will only appear for new characters created with version 5.116 or later.
- Fixed my own fix for limited spells. When I enabled limited spells to modify the DV of the spell, I accidentally broke the spells with drain greater than their force, for example Element Aura with its F+1 DV. This is now fixed properly.
- Removed the text entry when purchasing reagents.
- In light of the Personalized Grip, various holsters, and Spare Clips, I've updated all weapons to allow accessories. I may in the future add some more specialized handling of weapon accessories to be more specific to the weapon in question but for now this will at least allow usage of standard accessories.  In the end, while it's good if Chummer helps you follow the rules, it shouldn't prevent you from doing something that is legal within the rules.
- Fixed Social Modifiers for Voice Control (power), Tailored Pheromones (bioware), and Sleeping Tiger (armor).
- Fixed the karma costs of Foci during character advancement.
- Removed the Special menu item that would allow you to change your BP as it doesn't really make sense in 5th Edition.
- Reverted The Beast's Way and The Spiritual Way back to costing 20 karma AND added code so that if you have either of these qualities, you will not be charged to add a Mentor Spirit.  In Creation mode, you will be refunded the cost of your Mentor Spirit if you already have one. In Career mode you won't (you've already spent that karma).
- Updated the adept way qualities so that you may only pick one.
- During Career mode and as a Mystic Adept, taking Essence loss sufficient that it reduces your Magic score will also reduce your points allocated to Adept if they exceed your new Magic score.
- Fixed a bug which prevented a cyber weapon from using the Strength of the cyberlimb it is implanted within.
- Added Biotechnology to the Biotech skill group per the errata.
- Fixed Forgery by making it use Logic instead of Agility.
- Updated the character validator to not include the availability of Armor mods marked as "included in base armor" when determining the acceptability of the availability of the character's gear.
- Added Fetishes to Gear in the Magical Supplies category. They have no cost (and per the rules your character must create them) but this addition will enable you to show them in your inventory.
- Fixed a bug causing a character in Creation mode to show their starting nuyen instead of available nuyen on their character sheet.

Build 5.115 (beta)
- Added all of the remaining Street Grimoire content including Toxic Mentor Spirits, Blood Rituals, Insect Shaman tradition, Spirit Champion and Spirit Pariah Qualities, and Magical Items and Compounds.  If you find something that is missing, please let me know.
- Fixed Mentor Spirits with the Improved Ability adept power bonus which were causing a crash.
- Fixed a string bug that would cause a crash on Rituals using an Organic Link descriptor.
- Fixed the Ares Alpha by making its Smartgun System Internal rather than External.
- Fixed the various Cyber Implanted Guns by making their Smartgun System Internal rather than External.
- Fixed an error in the Select an Armor Mod dialog where some items allowed selecting a zero rating.
- Fixed an error in the Select an Armor Mod dialog where some items would cause a crash because they could be given a zero rating.
- Fixed Handheld Housing, Wall-Mounted Housing, Grenade-Cam, and Periscope Cam so that they can be purchased. Once purchased, you should be able to add a single sensor or sensor array (if you have enough capacity) and then populate the single sensor or sensor array with sensor functions. As best as I understand pages 445 and 446, this looks like how this is intended to function.
- Fixed an issue with vehicle sensors. Again, going by pages 445 and 446 and specifically the line "Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats)." I've set the rating of the Sensor Arrays for each vehicle equal to their sensor rating (or 2 if the vehicle/drone has a sensor rating of 1). If I got this wrong, please explain where I went wrong so I can correct it.
- Fixed the calculation for Unarmed Combat damage. Existing characters should delete and re-add their Unarmed Attack on the weapons list.
- Updated the license dialog to suggest more useful options. If you prefer the old method, you can turn it back on in the Options dialog on the Miscellaneous tab.  Either way, you can enter your own values by typing into the dropdown box.  For the XML inclined, you can add your own entries in licenses.xml. If you have suggestions for licenses to be included in the dropdown, send them to me.
- Updated Cool Resolve to provide its bonus to each of the Social skills.
- Fixed several bugs with the Enhanced Accuracy (skill) Adept Power. It was adding to the dice pool in error and not adding to the accuracy of weapons tied to that skill. Both of these issues have been resolved.
- Fixed a bug which would cause a weapon to not benefit from the correct skill.
- Cleaned up the tooltip for Initiative on the Other Information tab.
- Fixed the Matrix Initiative (Cold) calculated value.
- Fixed Limited spells so that they calculate the Drain Value correctly.

- Removing the One Trick Pony quality will also remove the Martial Art. Removing the One Trick Pony Martial Art will also remove the Quality.

Build 5.114 (beta)
- Renamed the character sheets from "Shadowrun 4" to "Shadowrun 5".  If you're just copying the new version into the same directory, you'll want to delete the files in the \sheets subdirectory named "Shadowrun 4" with the .xsl or .xslt extention.
- Added new book Bullets & Bandages and its contents (BB).
- Fixed a bug that prevented karma from being charged if points were added to Magic in excess of the character's Special Attribute points.
- Updated the cost of The Beast's Way and The Spiritual Way to 15 points to reflect the free mentor spirit these qualities grant.
- Added a discount field below the Bonded Foci listing on the Gear tab that can be used to enter the number of foci qualifying for your Adept Way's foci bonding discount. This was the simplest and most straightforward way to handle the Adept Ways and the foci bonding discounts they might provide.
- Added a new Standard (Burnout's Way) cyberware/bioware grade that is enabled if you take the Burnout's Way quality. It is always available on the Cyberware and Bioware tab on the grade dropdown to handle cases where an Adept had the Burnout's Way, got cyber/bio, and later dropped the Burnout's Way in favor of another Way.
- Fixed a bug preventing the Suprathyroid Gland from increasing your lifestyle costs.
- Fixed Skills and Skill Groups so that if Ignore Rules was selected they cap at 99.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when selecting the Adept power for the Thunderbird Mentor Spirit.
- Fixed several bugs causing errors with the Urban Tribe Tomahawk.

- Fixed the missing Ingram Valiant.
- Fixed Unarmed Attack so that it is automatically added.
- Fixed the price of the SecureTech Vitals Kit.
- Fixed a bug preventing commlinks, rigger command consoles, and cyberdecks from showing on the character sheet. Unfortunately you will need to remove and re-add the item to have it show correctly.
- Updated the "Shadowrun 5" character sheets, cleaning up the skills section slightly to reflect numbers needed in 5th Edition.
- Updated the "Commlinks" character sheet to show Shadowrun 5 specific values. Also now shows Cyberdecks and Rigger Command Consoles.
- Updated the "Vehicle Block" character sheet to show Shadowrun 5 specific values. Also now shows Seats on vehicles added with 5.114 or later versions and Accuracy on vehicle mounted weapons.
- Updated the "Game Master Summary" character sheet to show skill limits, the full set of initiatives, weapon accuracy, and single armor ratings.
- Updated the "Text Only" character sheet to show skill limits, the full set of initiatives, weapon accuracy, and single armor ratings.

- Added the missing Biomonitor to the Urban Explorer Jumpsuit.

Build 5.113 (beta)
- Added a fix to enable backward compatibility in reading characters created before 5.112.

Build 5.112 (beta)
- Added Rituals from Street Grimoire (SG).
- Added Metamagics from SG.
- Added Adept Ways from SG. I've included the discounts but just like Original Chummer, it's up to the player not to take more discounted powers than the 1 per 2 Magic. I will do a 2nd pass on the ways in the near future to restrict the discounts and to take a stab at adding the small bonuses the ways have like the karma discounts that some ways have as well as the cyberware essence discount that the Burnout's Way has and the skill bonus the Beast's Way has. For now, I was happy just getting the discounts working correctly.
- Fixed the price of the Yamaha Growler.
- Enabled the Spells and Spirits tab for Adepts. This allows Adepts to see the stats associated with their Mentor Spirit and to purchase Rituals. I'm currently omitting Rituals with the Spell keyword from the list they can purchase but will change this if it is appropriate to do so. I'm also omitting Rituals with the Adept keyword from the list for Magicians and Aspected Magicians.
- Updated the Add Spell dialog for use by Adepts by restricting selection to Rituals with the Adept keyword.
- Fixed the Taurus Omni-6 so that it gets the Revolver specialization in addition to Automatics.
- Fixed the Enhanced Accuracy Adept Power so that it asks which combat skill to enhance.
- Fixed a bug which allowed characters with more than 25 points in Negative Qualities to validate.
- Fixed a bug with YNT Softweave Armor which would cause it to show more capacity remaining than it should.

- Fixed the Negative Quality Incompetent to require selecting a skill group, not a single skill.
- Fixed the cost of the Positive Quality Strive for Perfection.
- Changed the name of the Natural Immunity qualities to Natural Immunity (Natural) and Natural Immunity (Synthetic). In addition, these qualities are no longer limited to selecting only one of them once.  Whether these should be restricted as such is a GM call.

- Made Resistance to Toxins, Resistance to Pathogens, and Resistance to Pathogens and Toxins mutually exclusive.
- Corrected Positive Quality Agile Defender's karma cost.
- Corrected Positive Quality Resistance to Toxins' karma cost.

- Removed the 4th edition limitation upon skills that limited skill bonuses to half of the skill rating.
- Fixed the Positive Quality Spirit Affinity to require that the character is an Aspected Magician, Magician, or Mystic Adept.
- Cleaned up the Priorities dialog and reordered the fields to match the Priority table on page 65.
- Removed two options from the Options dialog that no longer apply in 5th edition.

- Fixed an issue preventing spare clips from being added as gear to firearms and preventing adding ammunition to spare clips.

- Fixed a bug preventing bonus skill selection from appearing for Mystic Adepts while selecting priorities.
- Updated Mystic Adept Power Point cost to use the Errata value of 5 karma. I will add this as an option at a later date when I'm able to flesh out the Options dialog.

- Fixed a bug preventing Cyberdecks from being added to a Cyberware Head Cyberdeck.
- Fixed a bug with the Horizon Flying Eye so that the variant with the Flash Pak and Smoke Grenade is correctly listed.
- Fixed a bug granting more Knowledge Skill points than proper. Was figuring on (INT + LOG) x 3 instead of x 2.
- Fixed the qualities that have ratings (Focused Concentration, High Pain Tolerance, etc...) to be listed in the Select Qualities dialog for each rating value.  Previously it was only allowing you to select the quality once, preventing reaching higher ratings. Unfortunately this means that if you pick Focused Concentration (Rating 2), rating 1 and 3 are still there in the list.  This isn't my optimal fix for this and I'm going to try to find something better. Suggestions are welcome.
- Updated Electrochromic Clothing to be an allowed mod for armor.

- Fixed karma costs for skill groups when buying more than your priority selection grants.
- Fixed karma costs for skills when buying more than your priority selection grants.
- Fixed karma costs for knowledge skills when buying more than your attributes grant. This uses the original code for calculating these costs which forces the player to pay for the most expensive points rather than what might be the most optimal.  As an example, if you have two knowledge skills named A and B and have 6 free knowledge skill points. If you set A at a value of 4 and B at 3, you'll use your 6 free points to raise them each to three and then pay karma to raise A to 4 costing you 4 karma. The optimal path would raise A to 4, B to 2, and then pay karma to raise B to 3 costing you 3 karma.  I've coded everything else (active skills, skill groups, and both primary and special attributes) to use the optimal path for paying karma for items raised beyond what your priorities provide for and wonder if it might be the right thing to do that here as well.
- Fixed character loading so that it loads the total available primary and special attributes per priority selection.
- Now ignores armor encumbrance (was a holdover from 4th edition).
- Fixed an issue where gear standard to a piece of armor wasn't showing up.
- Added the missing Home Ground positive quality.
- Added the missing Uneducated, Unsteady Hands, and Weak Immune System negative qualities.
- Fixed an error with the High Pain Tolerance positive quality.
- Removed the ability to add the Ambidextrous positive quality multiple times (this was a holdover from 4th edition where there was the ability to have more than 2 arms).
- Fixed the suprathyroid bioware so that it doesn't cause an error. There is a remaining issue where it isn't updating the lifestyle cost accordingly. This will be fixed in a future release.

Build 490

- fixed an issue where ammoreplace values for Weapons were not being handled correctly
- added an Option on the Miscellaneous tab: Karma cost for increasing Special Attributes is reduced with Essence Loss (see below)

Karma cost for increasing Special Attributes is reduced with Essence Loss
When the option is enabled, the Essence cost to improve MAG or RES is affected by Essence Loss. For example, the character an Essence Penalty of 1 and MAG of 3. Normally, Chummer calculates the cost based on its perceived MAG value of 4 (MAG 4 - Essence Penalty 1 = 3), meaning the cost of improving MAG would be for going from MAG 4 to MAG 5. With this option enabled, Chummer instead calculates the cost based on the shown value of 3, meaning the cost of improving MAG would be for going from MAG 3 to MAG 4. This only impacts Career Mode.

PDF Support
PDF support has been tested with both Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader. Clicking on a sourcebook field (such as SR4 324) will open the linked PDF to the appropriate page. PDF links can be configured in the Options window. There are a few things to note with each application in terms of behaviour. With Adobe Reader, a new instance of the application is opened each time you click on a PDF link in Chummer. If you have the SR4 book open already then click on another SR4 link, a new copy of Adobe Reader is opened to the appropriate page, meaning you will have multiple copies of the SR4 book open at the same time. With Foxit Reader, if you already have the SR4 book open and click on an SR4 link, Foxit Reader will gain focus but will not jump to the appropriate page. Foxit Reader will only jump to the appropriate page if you do not already have a copy of that PDF open. Unfortunately these are not things I can control; they are how these reader applications have been setup to behave.

Relative File Paths for Contacts and Spirits
Contacts and Spirits now support relative file paths for improved portability between computers. Chummer first looks for the exact file name that was linked. If it cannot be found, it falls back to using the relative path that was stored when the save file was linked to it. This will only work with save files that are linked in this and later versions of the application. In order to get this behaviour with previous save files, you will need to remove the link and re-link the save file to the Contact or Spirit.

Free-Style Create Mode
When 0 BP or 0 Karma is entered in the Choose BP Amount window, the Create window now lets you create a character with an unknown amount of BP/Karma. As BP/Karma is spent, the character's point total is automatically calculated.

The BP/Karma field will turn red when the character's Primary Attributes are forcing the character to be calculated at a higher point total than the number of points that have actually been spent.

See the Creating Custom Improvements page on the Chummer Wiki for more information.

Metatypes now have the ability to mark their starting Qualities as removable by setting the removable attribute to "true". These Qualities can be removed in Create Mode and Career Mode by selecting them and clicking the Delete Quality button. Removing these Qualities will cost the appropriate amount of BP or Karma.

Adept Powers that Affect Base Attribute Scores
There has been a rather significant change (correction) to how a few Powers work in terms of affecting Attributes; namely Creative Eye, Improved Physical Attribute, and Keen Wits. The cost of these Powers were not being calculated correctly as they were not correctly modifying their Attributes' actual value, nor were they properly increasing the Karma cost of improving them in Career Mode. If your characters have any of these three Powers, you will need to remove them and re-add them so that things are calculated correctly.

- added support for Override Data Files (see below)

Override Data Files
Similar to Custom Data Files, Override Data Files let you override individual items, replacing the base data with your own version (for example, changing the cost and damage for a Weapon). These follow the same naming rules as Custom Data Files but use "override" as their prefix (such as override_weapons.xml). Multiple Override files can exist for the same type (such as multiple Override files for Weapons), and the files are loaded in alphabetical order after loading the base data files. The item in the Override file completely replaces the base item. This is not intended to be used for holding your new custom data as the XML Manager will only overwrite existing items; it will not add items that do not exist in the base data files. Use at your own risk.

Settings Files
Chances are, most people are just going to stick with the default one and modify it as needed. For those who take part in multiple games where the sourcebooks allowed and optional rules used varies, you can create additional Settings files to keep all of this information separate. To create a new Setting, copy the default.xml file in the settings directory, rename the new copy to whatever you like, then modify it using the Options window. When you create a new character, Chummer asks you which Setting you would like to use (if more than 1 file exists). The name Settings file used is saved as part of the character file. You can change the Settings file a character uses by opening the save file in a text editor and changing the <settings /> tag to match the name of the desired file. These files can be given to players to make sure that everyone has the same set of options enabled.

About Omae
Omae is an online character repository where players and GMs can upload their creations to share with others who are looking for Contacts, Enemies, and Critters for their games. Anyone can download characters, but you must have a registered Omae account in order to upload characters. Registration is required so that people can see who put the effort into the character, search for other creations by that person, as well as allowing only the author to update a revised version of the character or delete it entirely. Registration is free and only asks for a user name and password. No other information is asked for or recorded. I have no use for that stuff. Password are encoded and stored in the online database. You may also choose to save your user name and password information locally so that you can log into Omae automatically when you open the window. Password are stored in an encoded format within the Windows Registry along with the other Chummer settings. When a character is downloaded, it is saved to your [Chummer path]\saves\omae directory.

They will not be saved with your character information, so once you have closed the character, the undo history is lost (largely to prevent undoing something done 10 game sessions ago without undoing anything else). Currently supported items - Karma: Attribute, Karma: Add Quality, Nuyen: Cyberware/Bioware, Nuyen: Gear. This only undoes the expense for the item you have selected. If you later added child items you should undo these expenses first - the undo function strictly undoes the single item that is selected, meaning anything that was added after and not undone will not be refunded. This is intended to undo your most recent few transactions only.

Free Spirit Characters
Magic replaces Force since they are the same Attribute for the Free Spirit. When you first create a Free Spirit character, your Attribute BP total will be very high but is technically correct. All of the character's Attribute start at 2 and have a Metatype Maximum of 2 (the Free Spirit's starting Force/Magic). This means that all of your Attribute costs are being calculated at their Metatype Maximum which adds +15BP per Attribute. (This technically breaks all of the other written rules saying only 1 Physical/Mental Attribute can be at it's Metatype Maximum.) When MAG 3 or higher is selected, this number drops back down since they are all no longer at their Metatype Maximum. (And who would play a Force 2 Free Spirit anyways?)

A.I. Characters
Resonance replaces Rating. Their free Programs can be purchased through Gear by selecting the Free! checkbox when purchasing.

- Elemental Strike and Elemental Resistance Adept Powers now ask for a value to be selected
- <specificattribute /> Improvements now include support for precedence attribute which determines how they stack with other Improvements to the same Attribute (see below)

specificattribute precedence
This has been included to (and should only be used for) Cyberware, Bioware, and Powers that affect Initiative and/or Reaction which either does not allow it to stack with any other enhancement, or only certain ones. A precedence of 1 ignore all other Improvements and uses the COMBINED value of all other precedence 1 items (Wired Reflexes, Move-by-Wire, and Reaction Enhancers). A precedence of 0 ignore all other Improvements and uses the single highest precedence 0 Improvement the character has (Synaptic Booster). Short version: nothing you need to actually worry about - the necessary items have already been updated and Chummer figures out what it should use. :)

Changes to Qualities
Qualities have undergone a complete re-write. Existing character will convert their Qualities over to the new format when they are loaded. It is recommended that you immediately save your character after opening it to keep these Quality changes. The code to convert these Qualities will be removed around June 20 (update notes will be posted to inform of the change). Qualities are now handled like other items in that they can be added/removed using the Add and Delete buttons and are listed in a single tree. The Select a Quality window by default lists only the Qualities that the character may take - a checkbox is provided to show all Qualities, regardless of qualification.

Using books.xml as an example, "custom_books.xml", "custom_Nebular_books.xml", and "custom_ThatGuy_books.xml" are all valid names.

Once your character is ready to run, you can put them into Career Mode. Career Mode lets you maintain your character using Karma throughout their running career. Career Mode lets you keep track of your Karma and Nuyen expenses, buy and sell Gear, and even keep track of Ammo in each Weapon. To put your character in Career Mode, go to the Character Info tab, check the Mark character as Created box, then click Save. The save process makes sure that your character meets all BP/Karma and Nuyen total rules before saving. Once the character has been saved, they are re-opened in Career Mode. Once a character has been put into Career Mode, you cannot go back to Build Mode.

Custom Data Files
You can create custom data for each of the data files. To being, create a copy of an existing file and add "custom_" to its name. For example, to create custom Cyberware date, you would create a copy of cyberware.xml and rename it custom_cyberware.xml. This will give you the structure that the application expects. You can then create your custom items using the custom data file. The <version> information can be safely removed since it does not apply. Your custom information will be shown along with the application's own data where applicable.
