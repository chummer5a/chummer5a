At present, only Spirits should be available for use. Sprites and other critters will be enabled in a later patch. Fixes #1225

- Moved the AddQualities improvement nodes for qualities, cyberware and such into the Bonus node. This shouldn't affect existing characters, but custom content will need to be adjusted to reflect the change.
- Moved the method for the SelectText improvement. I don't EXPECT that this will cause any issues, but if you encounter any odd behaviour please let us know.

- Fixed an incorrect label for skill improvements in the Karma/Nuyen Expense History. Fixes #1046.
- Fixed an issue that caused knowledge skills to revert their type to Interest. Fixes #1056.
- Added an option to treat arms and legs as the only limbs to average cyberlimb stats off, instead of the skull and torso that are suggested by RAW. As part of this, the options have been broken out into a new XML file, options.xml. Minor design note, I intend to eventually have every calculation variable kept outside of the application logic itself; this will allow GMs to configure their characters as they wish.
- Fixed an issue with Adept Powers with multiple levels granted by a Mentor Spirit not apply properly. If your character is affected by this, you should be able to use the Reapply Improvements option in the Special menu to recalculate it properly. Fixes #1057.

- Fixed an issue where changing your priority selection would remove MAG/RES-linked skills.

- Added some code to suppress errors caused by faulty XSL transforms in character sheets.

- Fixed a UI issue that prevented attribute bonuses from showing properly if the value made it into double digits.

- Temporarily removed the CalculatedMovementSpeed tooltip from caeer and creation mode until it gets refacted.
- Added a workaround to prevent crashes when loading characters with empty knowledge skills. Fixes #1099.

- The "ignoreprecedence" improvement attribute has been renamed to "precedence-1".
- The initiativepass and initiativepassadd improvements now utilise precedence values to manage their stacking; this allows adding Improvements that will always apply, such as the Infected Initiative die bonuses.

- Fixed an issue that prevented the Knowledge/Contact multiplier house rules from enabling correctly.
- Changed the string Tip_SkillsKnowledgeSkills to display the correct multiplier entry.

- Fixed an issue with the Matrix condition monitor.

Data Changes:
- Fixed the Infected qualities to work according to the rules. Characters with previous versions of the quality should reapply their improvements, characters that used the terrible metavariant idea will not load properly and should be rebuilt from scratch.

Translation Changes:
- Updated the German translation files, courtesy of HaukeW.

Build 180:
Application Change:
- Total rewrite of skills.
    * Eliminated a lot (all?) old bugs
    * Opening the skills tab first time is now signifigantly faster
    * Searchbox for skills
    * Custom sorting of skills. Sort by Rating, Dicepool, Category and more
    * Skill tooltip now display dicepools for cyberarms
    * In Career mode, it is possible to calculate the dicepool using another attribute that the default one.
    * Some minor UI changes to acomodate new skill features
    * Skills that cannot be defaulted has their name in italics.
    * Easier maintainance
    * Reduced file size
- First things first, good news bad news. Good news, automatic updates will be functional again for updates after 179. Bad news, due to a change in implementation of the automatic updates this brings an end to .Net 4.0 support. Chummer will no longer launch without .Net 4.5 or higher installed on your system.
- Rewrote crash handling. Now dumps most/all internal state, making debugging easier.
- Built-in weapon accessories are automatically assigned to the Internal accessory slot by default. If a weapon accessory should take up a slot naturally, just add a <mount> value to the accessory. This change only affects newly created/purchased weapons, so any existing weapons will need to be altered manually or deleted and re-added. Fixes #566.
- Ammunition can now add and replace the fire modes of weapons, using the firemode and firemodereplace nodes of weaponbonus. This change only takes effect during career mode, and is currently used exclusively for the Taurus Omni-6's heavy ammo type. Fixes #577.
- Fixed a crash issue caused by changing priority selection in Sum to Ten mode. Fixes #572.
- Qualities can have their Limit assigned as either 'no' or a numeric value. This is intended as something of a placeholder until proper levels for qualities are implemented at a later date.
- Support for AI characters added. Xeno/Protosapients and E-Ghosts are treated as Metavariants.
- Weapon Accessories can now modify the AP, Damage and FireMode of weapons using the damage, damagereplace, damagetype, ap, apreplace, firemode and firemodereplace keys. Currently this is used exclusively for the Overclocked mod (Okay technically it's currently an accessory, but there's no practical difference between the two at the moment so it goes where I say it goes.) Fixes #472
- Handling for vehicles has been split up into normal and offroad handling. The implementation method should prevent any issues from cropping up, but I've eaten my hat on that before.
- Calendar entries can now be removed. Fixes #552.
- The optional rule to have Essence Loss only reduce RES/MAG maximums has been re-enabled. Fixes #596.
- Each spare clip added to a weapon now tracks ammo individually rather than the previous hard-coded limit of four active slots. As a result of this change, Spare Clips no longer have the ability to directly store ammunition as a child item; they will be updated to display their currently loaded ammunition as an Extra value shortly.
- New key node for Weapon Accessories: ammoslot. ammoslot is an integer that adds the associated number of 'spare clip' items to the parent weapon. In most cases this will be 1 (Spare Clip, Speed Loader, etc.), but someone will probably come up with banana magazines that count as two mags or something eventually. Future proofing!
- Qualities can now add natural weapons directly using the naturalweapons node. Mostly this is for the infected, because "Bite (Infected) 2" offends me.
- Fixed a string formatting issue that prevented Accuracy modifications from adept powers from working properly for translated Chummer.
- Fixed an issue that prevented priority/sum-to-ten from using the gameplay options for their nuyen limit.
- Sum to Ten and Priority now use the same form for character generation. Doesn't mean anything particularly interesting for you guys, but may reduce or introduce some interesting new bugs.
- Contacts can now be dragged around and reordered according to your whims. It's only really easy to do when the control you want to move is expanded.
- Armor can now have a Rating; currently this is used exclusively for the cloaks from Hard Targets.
- Fixed the percentage discount for basic lifestyles.
- Fixed a translation issue for licences.
- Fixed a translation issue for basic lifestyles. Fixes #608.
- Armor improvements can now use Precedence attributes; this means that we can prevent a group of armour improvements from stacking with each other. Currently this is used for a small selection of skin-related qualities and biowares. See the Data Changes for more details. Fixes #602.
- Fixed an issue with advanced lifestyles that created zombie qualities. Fun for the vodoun and shedim, everyone else not so much. Fixes #583.
- Fixed an issue that prevented infected from moving to career mode.
- Added a tooltip for the Movement label in the Other Info tab to show the calculated movement speed in meters per combat turn or Kilometres per Hour. Implements #574.
- Note tooltips now have a maximum with of 100 pixels. Prevents the tooltips for contact descriptions and such from running across the whole screen. There's a good chance I missed one or two, so let me know if you see any. Fixes #581.
- Fixed an issue relating to the Improved Ability power causing other powers to revert to 0 ranks. Fixes #488, fixes #436, fixes #378.
- Fixed an issue with Improved Ability and exotic weapon skills not working together. Fixes #492.
- Fixed adept powers to stack properly with free levels from qi foci and mentor spirits. May break in interesting ways. Should fix #615.
- Matrix initiative can now benefit from the MatrixIniaitivePass improvement. Fixes #618.
- Added support for FixedValues for vehicle mods. Fixes #622.
- Exotic Weapon skills without any karma spent on them can now be removed once you've entered career mode.
- Exotic Weapon skills can now properly have their karma costs refunded in career mode.
- Exotic Weapon skills can't change their specialisation dynamically anymore once you're in career mode, because it breaks the karma refund. This is intentional and is unlikely to be changed unless you can present me with better-implemented code or a reason it shouldn't be like it is.
- Skill specializations will now save their value as the English string if possible rather than whatever the user enters; this should fix #595. Note that this fix is PROBABLY not retroactive.
- Fixed some issues with lifestyle qualities not saving properly if they contained an extra value. Fixes #623.
- Active Hardwires now implemented according to the rules, fixes #617. They're effectively similar to skillwires, but you select the affected skill at the time of purchase. They're currently mutually exclusive, so you can't have skillwires and hardwires affecting the same skill. As with skillwires, the character's actual rating and their hardwire rating don't stack.
- Fixed an issue that prevented accessories that came with a weapon from being flagged as Internal.
- Fixed some calculation issues for priority metatypes not showing the correct karma value when changing from a metavariant to a base metatype. Fixes #537.
- Fixed a crash with metavariants in Priority/Sum to Ten. Fixes #647.
- Fixed a crash caused by weapon accessories that have a cost based on rating. Fixes #650, fixes #656.
- Added spell defence calculations in a tab on the right side of the career and creation windows. Closes #573.
- Changed the Improved Potential powers to use the limit modifier bonus instead of selectlimit; makes it a bit neater.
- Did some stuff to enable selecting multiple powers through the selectpower bonus node. This shouldn't affect any existing characters, but if you're using the Chaos Mentor Spirit I'd recommend deleting it and removing it. This miiiiight also break existing characters with Qi Foci. Probably not though. Like 70/30 at most.
- Did various shenanigans with the karma selection form to make it show qualities and karma costs properly.
- Rebuilt the functionality for Black Market Pipeline nad the Dealer Connection quality. Both should now work properly; there's a teeny tiny chance that existing characters that have the qualities might break, please raise a ticket if so.
- Fixed a crash caused by adding Genemods to a character with the Burnout's Way. Fixes #674.
- Fixed a UI issue that left the dropdown null when switching between genemods and bioware. Fixes #674.
- Enabled Vehicle Modifications to gain flat increases to Speed,Handling or Acceleration based on the Rating of the mod. Partial fix for #675.
- Fixed a visual bug with Limit Modifiers in creation mode. Fixes #665.
- Expanded the category selection mechanism to support falling back to default values. The general idea is that for each priority category loaded, it will attempt to load nodes that have a gameplayoptions node. If it can't do that, it'll load the Standard settings instead. This is intended to support alternate gameplay options as requested by #357. The actual data will need to be added for the appropriate categories, which I really can't be bothered transcribing.
- New Feature: Weapon Mounts will now limit the available weapons based on a predefined list of weapon categories. This also enables the weapon mounts added in Rigger 5.0 for adding weapons. I'm not particularly happy with how this looks in the XML so the underlying code might get changed over time. For now it's all good though.
- Fixed an issue that prevented magic- or reseonance-enabled karma-created characters from moving to Career mode.
- New Feature: Added a bunch of prompts to warn the user if they still have free contact points, knowledge points, skill points and such before moving to Career mode.
- Fixed an issue that caused a crash when adding armour to vehicles and drones.
- Partially implemented the Overclocker feature for Career mode. Code works, but I haven't added it on for Vehicles yet. Fixes #198.
- Added support for CTRL-A in the Notes forms. Slim chance I've missed other multiline forms Fixes #693.
- Fixed a crash caused by loading custom Critters related to movement strings.
- Fixed the display of Locations created by cybewrware or weapons with AllowGear properties. Fixes #536.
- Added some support for creating an Ally Spirit, per #244. Not 100% RAW yet, but it doesn't crash so that's a start.
- Added support for enabling calculated Public Awareness, per the rules from SR4. Hides the tooltips and calculations if not in use.
- Fixed the creation method for custom packs kits to not treat included mods as being purchased. Should fix #707 and fix #691.
- Save files is now in UTF-8 instead of UTF-16. This should not have any visible impact but it is more tool frindly and leads to smaller files
- Fixed an issue where qualities that add other qualities for free didn't discount properly. Fixes #762.
- Fixed an issue where default build methods other than Karma would cause a crash while launching the Options menu. Fixes #796.
- Fixed an issue with the Acceleration Enhancement modification causing a crash when printing. Fixes #772.
- Fixed an occasional issue in the Options menu where a null default character sheet caused a crash. Fixes #774.
- Added house rules to gain free contacts and knowledge skills based on the total value of your CHA or LOG+INT. Fixes #783.
- Fixed a bonus point calculation issue for YNT Softweave and Cloaks.
- Fixed a crash issue related to the Overclocker quality in career mode.
- Fixed a loading issue for commlinks with armor capacity values.
- Fixed an issue where removing a Foci before unbonding it would leave the Improvement enabled. Fixes #660. Note: Characters that have already been affected by this bug will need to manually remove the improvement.
- Fixed the ability to switch between adepts, magicians or technomancers when changing priority selections. Fixes #745.
- Added a method for grouping armour value improvements with the 'group' attribute. Fixes #758.
- Fixed an issue that prevented some old characters from being saved. Fixes #806.
- Added and consolidated some code to update initiation costs and discounts properly. Fixes #810.
- Implemented a minor quality of life update; the most recently used folder location is not stored for mugshots, per character. Fixes #458.
- Contacts, spirits and pets can now be linked to non-Chummer files; when clicking on the Open Character Sheet button, the file will be opened in the default application for that extension. Fixes #636.
- Prime runners now get twice the amount of free contacts compared to standard
- Essence Hole value is not impacted by grade or ware essence cost reductions. You don't get a little essence back each time now. Fixes #673
- "Test Subject" and "Factory Child Worker" life modules now give bonus nuyen. Fixes #811
- Fixed a crash caused when saving characters without mugshots.
- Fixed an incorrect value for binding spirit services. Fixes #827.
- Fixed karma costs for the Inspired quality from Sail Away, Sweet Sister in karmagen. Fixes #828.
- Added a close icon for the Options window, allows you to cancel out of saving any changes you make. Should fix #700.
- Chummer now correctly uses the "Characters don't gain Karma after Quality Limit" option in Karma and Life Module mode.

Build 178:
Application Change:
- Fixed a calculation issue for the Edge attribute when using Sum-To-Ten or Priority.

- Standard Knowledge Skills are suffixed with the Category they're a part of. There's a minor issue that preserves the skill name until the character is next loaded that will be fixed later.
- Clicking Add Again on the Spell Selection menu will preserve the currently opened spell categories. This is more or less just a proof of concept and will be expanded to other forms in later patches.

Build 177:
Application Change:
- Fixed a crash when selecting positive lifestyle qualities.
- Life Module backstories are now generated by a button press on the Character Info page.
- Print Preview mode is accessible from a context menu in the Character Print Viewer.
- Vehicles, Cyberware and Drones now have a Matrix Condition Monitor tracker. Note; the cyberware CM is effectively limited to 'root' devices, as in cyberlimbs, Wired Reflexes, things you wouldn't normally expect to be attached to other things. While I can fiddle with this setting easily enough, a bit of internal testing just left my testers confused as to whether they were bricking the parent device or not. Looking for feedback on this.
- Refactored a chunk of the Improvements code to use the new Log formatting. Mostly just stops it from throwing warnings at me during builds, but is a bit more human-readable.
- Fixed a bug that stopped lifestyle qualities from loading properly when edited.

- Fixed a calculation issue for lifestyle qualities.
- Fixed some issues that cropped up for 'ware that adds qualities (Daredrenaline, Metatype Reduction, etc.)
- Implemented support for selecting the slot that a weapon modiciation occupies. May break in interesting ways, but should allow holdouts and such to attach spare clips again.
- Commlinks and cyberdecks can now switch their ASDF attributes around. This capability will be properly segregated out into Cyberdecks in a later patch.

- Altered the way Weapon Accessories are handled to enable pre-configured Ratings. Custom-made weapons with built-in accessories will need to have their format changed to <accessories><accessory<name>Whatever</name></accessory></accessories>. Existing characters should load properly; please contact me if you run into any issues with this.
- Fixed a crash caused by the Extended Clip.
- Added Nanoware from Chrome Flesh.
- Proper bonuses added for most of the genetech from Chrome Flesh. Myostatin Inhibitor still doesn't have the karma discount, because it's tedious to implement.
- Fixed the minimum INT for Wakyambi to 2.
- Holdouts have had the <allowaccessory> tag set to true as a result of code changes to how accessories can be attached to a weapon. May not take effect on existing weapons; if not, remove and re-add the weapon.

- Removed the Sail Away, Sweet Sister version of the Personalised Grip, as it's replaced by the Hard Targets version.

- Prototype Transhuman works. Personal new metric: if I get more than twenty requests for a quality to be implemented within a month of the book coming out, that quality is broken.
- Made some changes to the calculation method for a character's Metagenetic Limit. Fixes an issue with the changeling limit being set incorrectly to 0 or making certain metagenetic qualities flag as standard.
- Weapon Accessories can have Ratings. Currently for things like Ceramic Components that have multiple levels.
- Fixed an issue with Weapon Costs caused by Ceramic Components.
- Fixed an error caused by Life Modules trying to give you attribute points over your metatype limit.
- Qualities that are not yet implemented in code will now have an <implemented>no</implemented> key that highlights them in red.

- Fixed the method for generating Advanced Lifestyle LP.

Data Change:
- Poor Self Control (Attention Seeking, Sadistic) now properly grant karma.

    Some provisional issues:

- The Fame qualities provide the associated Public Awareness increases.
- Added prompts for sides (Left, Right) for most cyberware that could reasonably be expected to need it.
- The Improved Potential power has been split up into three different powers, due to the way it works. Characters that have the existing power should work fine.
- Bioware Limbs from Chrome Flesh added.
- Additional Life Modules added. Most Life Modules now have a random story attached. The bulk of these stories are jokes, because it's good to laugh. Note: Checking and unchecking the Automatic Backstory checkbox on the Character Info page will select new random values, if they're present.
- Removed the Extravagant Eyes metagenetic quality.
- Fixed Karma values for the Cyclops Eye, Vestigial Tail and Feathers metagenetic qualities.

- Fixed the default values for free karma knowledge. If you have an existing settings file, please reset to defaults by clicking Tools > Options > Karma Costs > Reset to Default.
- Issues with Sum to Ten character generation artifically granting a MAG value higher than the metatype maximum should be fixed. I expect it'll break again in a week or so somehow, so please let me know if you experience any issues.

Data Change:
- Magical Education Life Module now has a proper karma cost; prevents crashes.
- Myostatin Inhibitor genemod now adds 1 Strength. The karma cost needs additional code support and hasn't been implemented properly yet.

- Chummer now handles essence holes automatically. Old items may need to be re-added.

- Fixed an issue where chummer failed to open when clicking on a .chum5 file.
- Implemented functionality for the quality "Friends in High Places".
- Save/Load methods for Advanced Lifestyles should actually work properly now, but it's still a bit fragile. Bugs are to be expected, particularly if you change your mind a lot.
- Most issues with adepts getting levels of powers from multiple sources should be resolved. (Mentor Spirits, Foci, etc.)
- Rounding issue for Recoil Compensation from Strength resolved.
- Variable costs for Qualities enabled to support the Rank quality. May eventually lead into redoing the way Qualities with multiple ratings work, because High Pain Tolerance (Rating 6) offends me every time I scroll past it.

Data Change:
- Organising data file contents into regions to keep things easy to work with.
- Rank Quality added.
- The Debug Lifestyle has been hidden.
- Lifemodules no longer contains a "Magical Education (Archetype)".
- Tír is now spelled correctly a few more places.
- Equipment, Weapon and Ammo PACKs from run faster added.
    There are a couple of important caveats with this:
    First, we generally haven't bothered to input PACKs that are a single item. If someone would like to write them up then that's fine, but there's only so many hours of data entry one can do.
    Second, items that don't currently exist haven't been added in, like backpacks. Again, mostly a tedium thing but the PACKs code doesn't play nice with Custom Item and I don't like littering up the data files with fluff items.
      Items not added include:
      - Backpack.
      - Sound-link on the earbuds.
      - Disposable inhaler from Cheap Soldier Pack.
      - Orange vest from Sportsman Pack.
      - Reusable Syringe from Tranq Darter Pack and Tranq Pistol Darter Pack.
      - Bug-out bag's dufflebag.
      - Mechanic Shop's duct-tape.
      - Surveillance pack's Periscope.
      - Infiltration Kit contains a Micro-Transceiver on the assumption that that's the correct item.
      - Medium Machine gunner pack doesn't contain ammo belts, but does come with the ammo.
  - Ammo packs not added as stacks split among multiple types of weapons is not possible in Chummer5a.
  - Rigger Pack gets Reaction Enhancers instead of the mythical reflex enhancers. Come on guys, it's a list of items. Seriously, if you need an editor I'm sure there's tons of people who'd be happy to sign an NDA.
  - Big Boom Pistoleer pack has 190 rounds of heavy regular amunition, because Chummer doesn't care about your brass.
  - Most lifestyles ignored, per the 'we can't be bothered adding single items' policy mentioned above.
  - Gunbunny pack not added as it contains unattached accessories, which Chummer doesn't currently like handling. To be added in a future patch.
  - Some custom packs added from reddit's shadowrun comunitieswith permission from /u/NotB0b and ShadowNET SysOp.
  - Fixed an issue with the Extreme Cyberimplant and Junkyard Jaw from Chrome Flesh.
  - Pulse Weave costs Rating * 3000.

New strings:
- Message_HighContact
- Checkbox_Options_Missions

Build 172:
Application Change:
- Due to the return of Move-By-Wire, Initiative is no longer capped to your REA+INT's augmented maximum.
- Fixed an issue with lifestyle quality costs that caused a crash on print.
- The cap for Qualities is now based on your Gameplay Option. For example, a Prime Runner can spend up to 35 Karma on Positive qualities, and gain 35 from Negative qualities.
- Compability mode added. Chummer should now **run** on .NET 4.0, but some stuff might not work, and we (the Chummer5a team) won't provide support.
- Fixed a bug where advanced (and normal?) lifestyles would crash on other languages
- More specific spirit data is available for charsheets to use.
- Chummer now has a crash reporter. If Chummer encounters an error it can't recover from, it will (if given permision) send a data package (hopefully) identifying the source of the crash.
- Chummer now won't pretend you have 25 BP in SumToTen/Priority build modes
- Fixed edge case where Sum To Ten would ask for a karma amount like Karma/Life Module builds
- Prime Data Haven now automatically creates/removes an appropriate 5C/3L contact.
- Cyberware can now add qualities. Not particularly happy with the implementation, but it works.
- Cyberware can have a metatype restriction.
- Born Rich quality works properly.
- The Select Bioware/Cyberware form can now display a special notes text field to indicate weird workaroundy stuff that I can't be bothered fixing with code.
    - For example, Striking Calluses are treated as a Rating item, with the Notes field explaining why. Currently has no support for translations.
- Essence Discount house rule enabled. Can be used to emulate the Prototype Transhuman quality for you munchkin mages that need your pain editors and whatnot until I get around to implementing it properly.
- Fixed an issue with the incorrect cap being used for spell selection. There's still a couple of UI failures that need to be resolved, but they're a relatively low priority.

Data Change:
- The Water Sprite quality confers +2 to Diving and Swimming, instead of prompting you to select one of them.
- Machine Pistols were missing a few accessory slots; they can now mount stocks and such.
- Cyberware Holdout Pistol typo fixed.
- Gameplay Options have been moved into their own XML file, gameplayoptions.xml.
- Added the missing qualities "Poor Self Control (Sadistic)" and "Poor Self Control (Attention-Seeking)"
- Lifestyles.xml GUIDs populated to support the language fix.
- Adapsin bioware properly discounts cyberware costs.
- Fire Modes for the Colt Inception have been fixed.
- Metatype Reduction has been added. Due to the differing benefits, it is split up into two different items for Orks and Trolls, respectively.
- Troll Reduction has been added.
- Assorted bits of cosmetic bioware and bio-weapons from Chrome Flesh have been added.
- Life Modules have been added from all existing source books, courtesy of joha4270 and angelforest. Functionality is complete-ish, but there are some awkward modules in Further Education and such that may not quite work as expected. Feedback and suggestions for this is greatly appreciated.
- Fixed an issue that stopped Aspected Magicians from gaining access to the Spells and Spirits tab. Replace-all is nobody's friend.

String Changes:
Altered:
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedNegativeQualitiesLimit
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedPositiveQualities
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedNegativeQualities
- Message_SpellLimit

New:
- MessageBox_NoValidContactFound

Build 171:
Application Change:
- Fixed an issue with Priority characters not loading properly. Malformed XML file.

Data Change:
- Accuracy for the Cougar Fine Blades altered.
- Chakram weapon added.
- The PPSK-4 has had a Collapsed Frame accessory added to it that confers -6 Concealability to represent the collapsible box thing you can put it in. Accessory mods can also no longer be installed on the gun.
- Blowgun range changed.
- Sound suppressor added to the Barret.
- Missing Ammo from Run and Gun added.
- Skilljacks and Skillwires have had their costs adjusted to match Chrome Flesh values, because apparently errata isn't a thing that's done these days.
- Wireless Skillsoft Networks have been added as Lifestyle Qualities. Yes, Advanced Lifestyles are still a little broken. It's on the list.

IMPORTANT NOTE:.NET 4.5.1 IS CURRENTLY A REQUIRED COMPONENT. CHUMMER WILL CRASH ON VERSIONS BELOW 4.5.1.

Build 170:
Application Change:
- Metasapient cost is properly counted in Sum to Ten and Priority.
- Fixed an issue with the default Free Contact Multiplier value. Existing installations may still have a Contact Multiplier value of 1. To fix this, open Tools > Options > House Rules and enable/disable the "Free Contact Points equal to Charisma times X" rule.
- Fixed an issue with the Critical Strike power that caused a crash, due to the name being changed.
- Jack of All Trades shows the proper tooltip value.
- Variable Sum to X character creation enabled. Changing Build Methods still doesn't work quite right, so it's recommended to make a new character if you want to do this.
- Genemods and Symbionts are locked to Standard grade properly.
- Internal changes to how some values are stored. Shouldn't affect characters.
- Added support for building characters with Life Modules.
    | If a character has multiple knowledge skills with the same name, they can optionally be folded in to one another by clicking the Collapse button on the right side of the skill.
    | Only debug life modules have been created thus far; any assistance in writing up the data for this would be greatly appreciated.
    | Selecting Life Modules will pre-generate a Background for your character. This can still be edited normally, but makes for a useful springboard. Development is still in the early stages, but is more or less functional. Full thanks to joha4270 for implementing this.

Data Change:
- Priviliged Family Name's SIN requirement changed to National or Corporate, rather than Corporate (Limited).
- Ambidextrous quality is now enabled for multiple limbs. Shine on, you crazy Indian diamonds.

- Fixed a missing value for the Linguist property that was preventing its bonus from working.
- Casemods can be removed from Cyberware.
- Living Focus and Keratin Control have been added to the Street Grimoire book. The Shadowrun Forum Post 1 book has been removed.

Build 169:
Application Change:
- Fixed an issue with skill and karma values defaulting to 0 in character creation.
- Fiddled with Auto-update a bit, might work better. Please test and advise.

- Content for Chrome Flesh added. Data provided courtesy of Fweeba.

Build 168:
Application Change:
- Did some stuff to make spell descriptors show up in character sheets.
- Karma carry-over for build methods other than Point Buy fixed to 7. You may need to reset your options to defaults for this to take effect. Tools > Options > Karma Costs.
- Fixed an issue with skills changing their values incorrectly.
- Fixed an issue with discounts for knowledge skills not working properly.

Data Change:
- Fixed a fault with the calculation of Net ranges that caused a crash.
- Data Trails content added. Some additional functionality for commlink dongles and such is still required, so they haven't been included yet. Much thanks to Iridios for his work with this.

Build 167:
New collaborator on the project acquired! joha4270 has been assisting with a variety of issues, and is currently tackling the implementation of Life Modules, along with several other tricky problems. Huzzah!

Application Change:
- Changes made to the Contact controls; most features of a contact are now only visible on hover. Makes things a bit neater. Looking for feedback on implementation of this. Good? Not good?
- Support for free contacts enabled.
- Support for group contacts from Run Faster implemented.
- Support for the Made Man quality from Run Faster implemented.
- Karma and Nuyen graphs now scale with time.
- Fixed a bug with calculation of Street Cred.
- Fixed a bug with Nuyen and Karma graphs being in order of addition instead of date. Also makes neat plateus and valleys.
- Fixed an issue in which the Maximum Modified Rating rule could not be disabled.
- Fixed issues with Limit Enhancements not saving.
- Technical School, College Education, Linguist qualities do the discounty things they're supposed to.
- Fixed issues with the optional rule to re-group skill groups if the skills were balanced when the character was saved.
- Fixed an embarassing issue with broken skill groups levelling themselves back down to the grouped rating.
- Fixed the behaviour of Custom Fit so that it only counts if the Custom Fitted item is also equipped. Not super happy with the code, but I'm also tired of looking at it, so eh.
- Undocumented inherited feature of the day: the <armoroverride> key supports Custom Fit. If an item with the Custom Fit (Stack) mod is equipped, and has an Extra value that matches another equipped piece of armour, the armour value of the item will be changed to the override value.
- Character creation validation now checks for Betaware/Deltaware and stops you from having nice things.
- Firemodes now work properly for languages other than English. (Original code didn't expect that someone would actually change the string for the firemode abbreviations, so kudos to you, random German guy who translated everything!)
- Made some alterations to the appearance and function of contacts. Outstanding issues: Made Man and karma costs don't update properly.

Data Change:
- Fixed a big with Colt Agent Special not using Heavy Pistol ammunition.
- Fixed incorrect calculation for varieties of Indomitable.
- Hanuman name fixed again. Frankly CGL should take the initiative of spelling the name correctly, for I am incapable of spelling errors.
- Enhanced Articulation no longer prompts for the skill bonus.
- Keen-eared and Balance Receptor are properly marked as Metagenetic qualities.
- Digital Doppelganger now prompts for a text entry, and requires that you be a SINner.

- Fixed an issue with Spirit Bane being available to non-magic users.
- Fixed an issue that enabled the free knowledge skills for point buy if the free contact point house rule was enabled.

Build 165
Application Change:
- Knowledge skills actually fixed now. Is now completely buildmethod-agnostic, so won't break when you look at it funny.

Data Change:
- Fixed an issue with Hanuman in Sum-to-Ten/Priority.

Build 164
Application Change:
- Martial Arts are no longer included in the calculations for positive quality limits at chargen.
- Fixed an issue in which point-buy characters weren't having points removed after patch 162.
- Fixed an issue with characters that had Middle/Medium lifestyles causing a crash.
- Fixed a number of stupid errors with knowledge skill and contact calculation. Knowledge skills still need an errata to confirm whether/how they're supposed to interact with karma and free points in point buym but should otherwise work correctly.
- House rules enabled to provide for a different contact and knowledge skill multiplier.
- House rules to override quality limits without otherwise breaking chargen rules enabled.

Data Change:

Build 163
Administrative Change:
- Controls (Skills, groups, etc.) moved into a separate folder because I'm tired of looking for them and can't be bothered prefixing. Organisation is love. Organisation is life.

Application Change:
- AUTOMATIC UPDATES ENABLED. Now I just have to not forget to update the version metadata every time I fiddle with something...
    - To use automatic updates, open the Tools window and click on Check For Updates. Any new file versions should be available for download. Select the files, hit the download button and cross your fingers.
- Fix for Friends in High Places causing a crash due to invalid bounds.
- Fixed an issue with free karma knowledge reverting values to 0.
- Rewrite of Knowledge Skill BP calculation to support free points. Needs some logic validation.
- Fixed an issue with the Blind (Mage) quality causing an exception.

- Added functionality for the College Education quality from Run Faster.

Data Change:
- Updated some spells with correct ranges, from the errata.
- Updated some martial arts, courtesy of Urs Zeidler.

Build 162
Application Change:
- Points for free Contacts include Karma values.
- Amended an issue where the first point of Connection or Loyalty was free for Contacts. Basing this off the example text on page 99, but I'm moderately sure that there was a falling out between the development team and the writers at some point, so they may not have been talking at that point.
- Added an optional rule to generate free contacts during Point Buy. Currently working on adding free contact points during Point Buy. Shouldn't be much longer to complete.
- Refixed an issue with skill groups adding points to the Priority number counters.  Will also clean up karmagen characters that were built accidentally using Points instead of just Karma.
- Fixed issues with the Uneducated, Infirm, and Uncouth qualities during chargen. (Additional karma costs, wrong karma costs, just generally broken.)
- Support added for the School of Hard Knocks quality.

Data Change:
- Blind (Mage) quality is now available for Adepts that have the Astral Perception quality.

- String_OverContactPoints

Build 161 (Reverting things that weren't broken Hotfix)
Application Change:
- So it turns out that the default options don't actually populate from where they're defined, but are an entirely separate int. Todo: buy scotch. Try not to cry. Cry deeply.
- Fixed the issue with skills doubling their rating on load. Commenting out code without explaining why you did it is dangerous, kiddies. Don't uncomment things you don't know the purpose of.

Build 160
Application Change:
- When using Point Buy, karma can no longer be carried over into Career Mode, because Point Buy cannot have nice things.
- Sum to Ten now validates over/under limits.
- Nuyen cost for Martial Arts and styles removed, because I'm an idiot and didn't pay attention to what Instruction Cost meant.
- Revalidated default karma options again, default value for contacts changed.
- Added a prompt to close open characters when changing Options. Will look at this again properly later to support saving the characters and reloading them, but for now it just closes, prompting the user to save any modified characters.
- Did some fiddling with the UI for Point Buy and the optional 'Free Knowledge Skills like Priority' rule. Buy With Karma is enabled by default, etc.
- Removing Rituals should no longer cause terrible crashes in chargen mode.
- Complex Forms limited to the correct amounts during Chargen and Career mode.
- Drone Condition Monitor assigned to correct value, courtesy of BodieSullivan.

New Strings:

- Base Recoil Compensation increased to 1. Recoil granted by Strength reduced to STR/3.
- Default state of the rule "Allow broken skillgroups to be regrouped if they have an equal value." changed to enabled.
- Improvements generated by Foci binding (Improved Physical Attribute, for example) are now removed when a Focus is unbound. Should fix edge cases that were effected in a similar manner.
- Negative Metavariant karma points count towards the Negative Quality limit. (Ie, a priority C hobgoblin can only take 20 Karma worth of Negative Qualities.)
- Limited support for using web-browsers (Chrome, Firefox) as your PDF application added. IE doesn't work, and I'm not interested in figuring out why.
- Power Point limits are re-calculated when Karma values are changed.
- Essence Loss during Karmagen correctly pulls from Karma.
- PACKs validated for functionality. They should work, but TERRIBLE HORRIBLE CRASHES WILL HAPPEN IF A PACK INCLUDES AN ITEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. The default set of PACKs will be created in the near future.
- Advanced Lifestyles are enabled in creation mode. Basic lifestyles have currently been disabled, because I am lazy and haven't remade it. I've only done limited testing with this, so please report any issues that you come across.

Data Change:
- Concealed Quick-Draw Holster: Concealment value set to -1.
- Custom Ballistic Mask: Social Limit increased to 2.
- Uniform (Disguise) crash fixed.

Data Change:
- Technomancer, Adept, Mystic Adept, Magician, Aspected Magician and Changeling qualities no longer contribute towards quality limit during karmagen.
- SURGE qualities all tagged as metagenetic improvements to support the new way SURGE works. Also should have been done from the start, but that's neither here nor there.
- Colt New Model Revolver amended to use proper statistics.

Build 5.157
Application Change:
- Karma calculation issue fixed in karmagen for special attributes. (Sure, let's include a specific handler for priority gen and nothing else. Makes sense.)

- Karma calculation issue fixed in karmagen. (Wasn't counting metatype minimmums.)

Data Change:
- Special Attributes for Priority-Gen and Sum-to-Ten fixed to proper values. Got a bit lazy copying the data.

Data Change:
- Metavariant/Metasapient BP costs and karma values shifted into Priorities/SumtoTen.xml files because Hobgoblins are terrible.
- Ares HVAR book reference altered to proper book (Run and Gun)

Issues:
- Metavariants that confer bonus karma (Hobgoblin, Oni at Priority C) currently are not counted against the maximum limit for Negative Qualities.

Build 5.155
Application Change:
- Settings.xml default values validated against what they're actually supposed to be. Fixes some issues with Quality prices, fixes the 5000 Nuyen per Build Point issue AGAIN.
- Metasapients partially added. (They're in, but prices are largely incorrect)

Build 5.154
Application Change:
- Change Metatype/Priority Selection special menu fixed to remove and disable Special attributes if you no longer have the relevant Talent. Needs some extra things done later to clean it up, but it works.
- Fixed a Nuyen calculation issue that stopped starting nuyen from being included.
Data Change:
- Restored a fix to Elf metavariants that caused a crash.
- Settings.xml will no longer be published in builds, to prevent issues with debugging data.

Build 5.153.2
Application Change:

- Removed needless, broken validation that stopped karma-nuyen conversion from working in priority/sum-to-ten builds.

Build 5.153.1

Build 5.153

Build 5.149

Build 5.145
Administrative change:
- Data files now embedded in the solution, rather than maintained separately.

Build 5.144
Data changes:
- "Resistance to Pathogens and Toxins" renamed to "Resistance to Pathogens/Toxins" due to weird dwarf racism issue.

Mea culpa changes:
- SVN/Backup issue forced a rollback of 5.141's Submersion fix.

Build 5.143

- Attribute count not counting current values in Sum-to-Ten fixed.
- Submersion fixed; Echoes are now purchasable.

Build 5.140
- Fixed the tooltip showing the karma values for raising magic in career mode.
- Added a new Dwarven racial quality to include the resistance to pathogens and toxins rather than using the Resistance to Pathogens and Toxins positive quality. This will only impact characters created with this version or later.

Build 5.139
- Added in the ability to multi-specialize in skills post character creation.
- Updated Mnemonic Enhancer to provide its bonus to the Mental Limit and Memory Tests.
- Updated Tailored Pheromones to provide a flat bonus to the social limit instead of a limit modifier.
- Fixed a bug with Qi Foci that could prevent it from showing the power it provides in the bound foci list.
- Updated Martial Arts so that it prevents taking the same Technique via the same Martial Art so you can have stacked bonuses.
- Fixed the Advanced Safety System from Run and Gun so that it would be available for use.
- Added the new spirits from Spirit Grimoire to the specialization lists for each of the Summoning skils.
- Fixed a bug that would occur when undoing adding a submersion grade in Career mode that was preventing it from correctly removing echoes attached to that submersion grade.
- Fixed a bug that was causing vehicles to show a Signal rating which was an artifact from 4th Edition.

- Fixed a bug that was allowing multiple attributes at maximum during character creation if the character had the Exceptional Attribute positive quality.

Build 5.138 (beta)
- Fixed the spelling on the name of the Evo Armadillo Armored Spacesuit.
- Fixed the calculation of the Mortimer of London coats when dealing with unequipped armor.
- Updated Chem Seal and Environmental Adaptation for Full Body Armor to be mods for Full Body Armor rather than armors themselves.
- For the Translator: Fixed both the Page and Translated columns so that they correctly save changes.

Build 5.137 (beta)
- Before anything else, I want to thank Geg (chummer5de@gmail.com) for going above and beyond working on the German translation for Chummer. A very large part of Chummer's data files have been translated into German by Geg over the last week and I cannot thank him enough for taking it upon himself to do this.
- In order to resolve differences between the English and German printings, I've added a new book entitled "Shadowrun 5th Edition (German)".  I've attached to this book the German versions of the Raven Mentor Spirit and Skilljack Cyberware.  This should allow German players to use the versions printed in their books and other players to use them if their group is treating those rules as errata to the English book.
- Updated Contacts by splitting the Name field into three fields: Name, Location, and Archetype. The dropdown has been moved to Archetype. Any existing Contacts will show any existing info under Name.  The character sheets have been updated to show the new Contact fields.

- Removed the Restrictive quality from SWAT Armor that was there in error.
- Fixed a bad tooltip for the Cyberlegs house rule.

- Fixed the price of the Armanté Suit and Dress.
- Fixed a formatting problem with the skills list so that the list should now scroll properly.
- Fixed a bug preventing leftover nuyen from being carried over after character creation.
- Added the ability to enter notes for Martial Art Techniques which are also shown on the character sheet.
- Added the Custom Tradition to Career mode.
- Fixed the Drain Resist dice pool for limited spells.
- Fixed the armor calculation for stacking armor including occasionally stacking items like the Mortimer's High-Fashion armor.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent adding the free adept powers granted by a mentor spirit if in Career mode.

Build 5.136 (beta)
- Due to popular request, Enemies are back again. These are not part of 5th Edition (at least not yet) so using them is a house rule.
- The Contacts/Enemies UI has been updated to use tabs rather than being stacked.  This gives a little more room for both contacts and enemies.
- Contacts now show a dropdown list for the name allowing you to enter your own contact information or select one from a list. As of yet, Enemies have no options in the list but this will be added at a later date (suggestions welcome).
- Added logging to the update function. Hopefully this will be helpful in tracking down issues when downloading updates.
- Removed a possible bug that could cause the update to go into a loop.
- Added a new Buy With Karma checkbox to each of the Active and Knowledge skills in Creation mode that allows you to buy the specialization with karma instead of skill points.
- Added tooltips to the house rules on the options dialog to help explain which each house rule does.
- Added a house rule to the Options dialog that will allow Initiation and Submersion during Create mode.
- As it was pointed out to me that I missed the sentence on page 66 that explicitly allows spending Attribute Points on the bonus point granted by Exceptional Attribute or Lucky, I've removed the house rules relating to Exceptional Attribute and am now following the rules as specified.  Sorry for any confusion.

Build 5.135 (beta)
- Minor fix to enable downloading the translator app via Chummer update.

Build 5.134 (beta)
- Now includes a translator application (Translator.exe).  This app allows you to create and edit the language files to translate Chummer into non-English languages.  If you're interested in doing a translation for distribution with Chummer, please let me know via srchummer5@gmail.com and we'll make arrangements for you to send me updated language files.  This is the first release of this translator app so please let me know if you run into problems using it. There's a bit more to come for handling translation, this was just the first big step.
- To resolve an issue with Exotic weapon skills, special weapons were moved into the appropriate Exotic weapon category.
- Fixed a bug that could cause Adept Power Points to be miscalculated in Career mode when adding cyber/bioware.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when printing your character.
- Removed the Enemies section as this was a leftover from 4th Edition.
- Removed the duplicate Narcoject entry.
- Added the low-light and infrared flashlights from the core book.

Build 5.133 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when adding adept powers.

Build 5.132 (beta)
- Added a House Rule "Use Skill Points on broken groups" that allows you to spend Active Skill Points in Creation mode on skills belonging to broken skill groups.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent raising Edge, Magic, or Resonance to maximum.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash if a skill group was raised which included a skill that had free levels.
- Fixed the page numbers for a handful of Illusion Spells.
- Removed a duplicate entry for Gamma-Scopolamine.
- Removed the button to add Adept Power Points in Career mode for Mystic Adepts.
- Fixed a bug that would erroneously charge a special attribute point when puchasing cyberware or bioware.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the range values for a number of thrown weapons from being shown.
- Fixed a bug causing new spirits added in Create mode being added by a Mystic Adept to have the wrong Force value.
- Fixed a spelling error on the Shadowrun Forum Post 1.
- Added Advanced Medkits from Bullets & Bandages.  No availability is listed for Advanced Medkits in B&B so I just used the availability for standard Medkits.
- Updated the validation warning message concerning having gear over capacity so that it now specifies exactly which items are over capacity.
- Fixed a bug that would throw up a validation error on characters using Prime Runner stats that have more than 25 karma in positive or negative qualities.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Prime Runners from converting to Career mode.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the character load to fail if it was a Prime Runner with more than 10 karma spent on nuyen.
- Updated the Missile Mastery Adept Power to include the +1DV and +1 Dice on Thrown Weapons.  Not sure this is the correct fix though as this is only supposed to apply to non-explosive thrown weapons.
- Fixed a bug allowing purchase of more levels than should be allowed on Flexibility, Stillness, and Penetrating Strike.  This fix will only apply on powers added after this update.
- Fixed a bug with the Ares Giantslayer Slingshot that was causing a crash when selecting it.

Build 5.131 (beta)
A quick shout out... I had programming help on this build from a friend of mine named Ed.  Thank you Ed!

- Completely rebuilt how karma is spent on Attributes, Special Attributes, Skill Groups, Active Skills, and Knowledge Skills to reflect the RAW on the steps in character creation. All existing characters should load up just fine but karma costs may have changed to reflect applying the RAW. Each of these now have separate entry boxes for applying points from your Priority selection and for buying up with Karma. Validation now checks to see if you've overspent on your points.  I believe I've been able to correctly handle the steps as written while giving a UI that allows you to treat it as a single step (rather than going through a gateway similar to "Mark as Created").  The only thing I haven't updated as part of this is whether skill specialization is paid for with skill points or karma... at this time it automatically uses skill points to pay for skill specialization but I'll update this in a future enhancement when I will also tackle being able to have multiple specializations per skill.  There are two new house rules to allow you to tailor how these rules are applied to some degree. If others are needed, send along a request and I'll take a look.
- Added custom Traditions. If you select the Custom Tradition from the dropdown, it will enable additional fields for you to provide your tradition name, select your drain attributes, and select your spirits for each school.  This information is saved with the character and is portable with it.
- Fixed the skill bonus from the Cat Mentor Spirit so that it will apply to Sneaking (the English core book says Infiltration on page 321).
- Spell dice pools should now pull from the correct skill (Spellcasting, Ritual Spellcasting, Alchemy, Artificing) for each spell.
- Corrected the drain value for the Resist Pain Spell.
- Fixed the values on the Build Summary tab for Spells, Complex Forms, and Contacts which under some conditions might show the wrong value.
- Fixed the Armor value on the Condition Monitor tab in Career Mode to show the correct value.
- Added the armor encumberance rule from page 169 so that it applies to armor accessories such as helmets and shields.
- Removed the duplicate Astral Powder gear entry.
- Fixed the missing availability and price for Fetishes.
- Clicking on a blank area within the Contacts, Skill Groups, Active Skills, or Knowledge Skills regions will allow you to scroll them with the scroll wheel.
- Removed the tooltips that were showing the wrong text on the labels on the Limits tab.
- Added a house rule to allow paying only the standard cost for Qualities in Career Mode instead of double as per RAW.
- Removed the option to buy a vehicle used as this was from 4th Edition and has not been carried over into 5th.

Build 5.130 (beta)
- Removed some duplicate specialties from the Politics Knowledge Skill.
- Made the Adept Way Qualities not available for non-adepts.
- Added the Astral Limit to the Limits tab and the character sheets.  Keep in mind that limit modifiers to either your mental limit or social limit that can apply in the astral might conditionally apply to your astral limit during play.
- Fixed Enhanced Articulation Bioware so that it applies the correct skill bonuses.
- Fixed several issues surrounding full Cyberlimbs. Attribute averaging has been removed as it was a 4th Edition rule. The limb on the character sheet now shows the limb's total Strength, Agility, and its Physical Limit.
- Movement rate now uses the augmented Agility value.
- Added an option under House Rules to use derived Attributes from Cyberlegs when calculating movement speed.
- Added all that lovely Qi Foci code from build 5.129 to Career Mode as well. Completely missed that one.
- Now correctly charges double for positive qualities added or negative qualities deleted after character creation.
- When selecting YNT Softweave in the Select Armor Mod dialog, it will now show "+50%" in the capacity field.
- Removed the button in Career mode that allowed adding more Mystic Adept Power Points. You're not actually allowed to add points this way after character creation.
- Added Custom Ballistic Mask.
- Added the specialized silencer for the Ares Light Fire 75 and added it to the Ares Light Fire 75.
- Added some very minor fixes for the underbarrel weapons from Run and Gun so at least they won't cause a crash.  They still don't behave the way I want them to though so I'll be revisiting this "soon".

Build 5.129 (beta)
- Qi Foci will now ask what power they're providing when you bind the foci and that power will now show up on your list of powers with the appropriate free levels if any and the name of the Qi Foci will be updated to show the power it is providing.  For Improved Reflexes, select the level you want your character to have and the foci rating, it will reduce the power point cost accordingly.
- Fixed a bug preventing weapons from being added to Heavy Weapon Mounts.
- Updated firearms that come stock with a Smartgun System to have the internal version.
- Added the Gas-Vent 2 System that the Ares Crusader II should have.
- Fixed the AP on the Colt M23.
- Manabolt is now correctly a Mana based spell.

Build 5.128 (beta)
- First and foremost, recent builds (including this one) have been getting updates to the French translation files courtesy of Lous_59. Thank you for your amazing work!
- Fixed a bug preventing loading bows or crossbows with ammunition in Career mode.
- Cleaned up the former Commlinks section on the Character Sheet.  It now is the Device section and each Commlink, RCC, or Cyberdeck shows itself as such.  Fixed a few problem items that were showing their stats incorrectly.
- Added device stat labels to cyberware, armor, weapon, gear, and vehicle tabs so that you can see the stats for selected commlinks, cyberdecks, or rigger command consoles.
- For newly created characters only, limit modifiers will now inlcude the condition under which they operate.  I'd make this retroactive but it would be a nightmare to code.
- Fixed the Quality Indomitable and the Adept Power Improved Potential to add directly to the calculated limits rather than add limit modifiers as these bonuses apply at all times.  This also resolved the issue with the Chaos Mentor Spirit where it was not applying the bonus from the granted Improved Potential power.
- Fixed a bug where in some cases carry-over karma from character creation would not be carried over.
- Will now automatically remove the Allergy when removing the Eagle Mentor Spirit.
- Fixed the Initiation/Submersion tab so that it will allow adding multiple instances of metamagics and echoes that allow it.
- Updated the Infusion of [Matrix Attribute] and Defusion of [Matrix Attribute] so that they will ask for you to enter the name of the attribute being adjusted.  For now it is a text entry, at some later date it may become a drop down.
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the karma calculation when increasing skills belonging to a broken skill group in creation mode.
- Updated the Select a Mentor Spirit dialog to not show choices you're not eligible for.  So Magician options won't show up for Adepts and Adept options won't show up for Magicians.  Mystic Adepts still see all options.

Build 5.127 (beta)
- Fixed a bug where it was not rounding Essence up when calculating your Social Limit.
- Fixed a bug which would prevent adding Sensor Functions to Sensors.
- Fixed a bug which would prevent any metamagics from being shown when selecting a new metamagic.

Build 5.126 (beta)
- Completely replaced the Initiation tab. It now should correctly handle Initiation (with discounts), Arts, Enchantments, Enhancements, Metamagics, and Rituals. Add an Initiation grade and then right click on the grade to add Arts, Enchantments, Enhancements, Metamagics, and Rituals.  In case you're not using Street Grimoire or choose not to use the Arts system, there is a new item on the House Rules tab of the Options dialog that you can use to ignore the Art requirements for metamagics and the like.
- Fixing the above item led to two powers referenced in Street Grimoire that haven't previously been published.  These have only been provided via a forum post by one of the designers.  So that post is now a source (SFP1) that can be enabled in order to provide those powers (Keratin Control and Living Focus).
- Updated all "Source" labels on all dialogs to open the linked PDF to that page if you have linked the book to the PDF in the Options dialog.  Also linked the names of skills and powers as they don't show a "Source" label in their listings.  And finally, the above mentioned forum post will open in your default browser if a Source pointing to it is clicked.
- Added the Small Unit Tactics Knowledge Skill from Run and Gun.
- Fixed a bug allowing the Seducer's Adept ability to allow any skill. It now restricts to the correct list. Thank you Ariketh for the solution!
- Fixed the Voice Control Adept power to allow for multiple levels.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when using YNT Softweave on an armor with an odd armor value.
- Added a variable price to Personalized Grip to reflect that it probably should cost something.
- Removed cyber-weapons from the Select a Weapon dialog. These can only be purchased now on the Select Cyberware dialog.
- Fixed a bug preventing the Respirator from being available to add to armor.
- Fixed a bug causing newly added Knowledge Skills to cap at 6 in career mode.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the tooltip on the button to increase your skill level to show the wrong value when in career mode and at rating 6.
- Fixed a bug that prevented adding Sensor Arrays (and quite a few other things) to vehicles while in Career mode.
- Adjusted the Select Weapon and Select Armor dialogs so that they'll have better performance.
- Fixed the price of the Monofilament Chainsaw.
- Fixed a multitude of bugs with the Complex Forms and Sprites tab in Career mode for Technomancers.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the wrong cost to be calculated for binding Counterspelling, Ritual Spellcasting, Spellcasting, or Sustaining Foci in Career mode.

Build 5.125 (beta)
- Fixed Damage and AP value for EXplosive Ammo
- Fixed a bug which would prevent the Dragonslayer Mentor Spirit from getting the bonus to a social skill.
- Added a separator between gear items attached to armor on the "Shadowrun 5" character sheets.
- Fixed a bug preventing refunding of Complex Form points when deleting a Complex Form.
- Weapons will now correctly inherit availability modifiers from accessories which should increase the weapon's availability.
- Removed 4th Edition artifact where Improved Physical Attribute was charging double for attributes raised above metatype max.
- Fixed a bug which could cause the movement formula to give incorrect values (it wasn't using the total value including augmentations).

Build 5.124 (beta)
- Fixed the crash non-US users were having when adding a Mentor Spirit.

Build 5.123 (beta)
- Fixed Security Armor: Heavy's armor rating.
- Added debug logging. By default this is turned off for performance reasons but if you encounter a significant error, I may ask you to turn it on so that the error can be captured and logged which will make my fixing the problem much easier.  If you do need to turn it on, you'll find it on the Options dialog listed as "Use Debug Logging".  For space reasons, if the log is turned on it will automatically clear itself each time you start Chummer.  At this time, only a small portion of Chummer's code is set up for debug logging but I'll be expanding this as I can.

Build 5.122 (beta)
- Fixed a number of bugs relating to Mentor Spirits and as best as I can tell, they're all working as intended. If you find otherwise, please email me a copy of your character sheet with a brief explanation of what's going wrong.
- Mountain Mentor Spirit now provides its bonus to Counterspelling
- Doom Mentor Spirit now correctly provides a +2 to the combat skill of your choice if you choose that option.
- Mutation Mentor Spirit now correctly asks for which ability to apply Attribute Boost.
- Eagle Mentor Spirit now automatically applies "Polutants" as the trigger of your Allergy.
- Dog Mentor Spirit now asks which senses are being improved.
- Moved the Smartgun System on the Savalette Guardian to be Internal.

Build 5.121 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that was preventing purchase of Binoculars (both digital and optical).
- Fixed a bug that was causing a soft crash when clicking on a weapon accessory.

Build 5.120 (beta)
- Updated the counters on the Build Summary tab to go into negative values if you use karma to overspend.  So if you have 3 contact points and add a 2/2 contact, it'll show "-1 of 3".
- Replaced the karma calculation for over-spending on Knowledge Skills. In short, the old mechanism was what was built in original Chummer and made you pay for the most expensive Knowledge Skill point from any of your Knowledge Skills when you went over. The new mechanism works just as the Active Skills (and Attributes) does meaning it looks for the cheapest possible option.  So if you had four points of Knowledge skills available and put 4 in skill A and 1 in skill B, the old method would charge you for raising skill A from 3 to 4 while the new method charges you to raise skill B to 1 (figuring out that the cheapest method is to put those four free points in skill A and pay karma for B).  This means that if you have an existing character still in character creation mode that spent karma on Knowledge Skills, you'll likely get some karma back.
- Fixed a bug that was incorrectly calculating your spent contact points.
- Fixing an issue with auto-update. I think this will stabilize auto-update and handle broken downloads better but I won't know for sure until we try.
- Fixed the price of the Redundant Power Supply.
- Changed Ares Predator V from External to Internal Smartgun System. This change will only apply on newly purchased Predators.

Build 5.119 (beta)
- Added Alchemical Preparations.
- Fixed a bug causing a crash when using Weapon Commlinks and Commlink Accessories.
- Fixed a bug that would improperly load adept powers if the character has more than one instance of that power.
- Fixed a bug with the Wolf Mentor Spirit that would cause a crash when selecting the Adept power.
- Fixed the capacity cost of Trodes.
- Fixed a bug that would excessively reduce the attribute minimum for Magic or Resonance when taking on an Essence reduction. This would cause Chummer to attempt to raise the attribute back to where it was by spending karma if need be.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Hand Blades from being available for purchase.
- Added a few more license options (based on Third Edition SR with the help of SpellBinder).
- Fixed a bug with audio enhancements (specifically the Audio Enhancement and Select Sound Filter) that weren't consuming capacity.

Build 5.118 (beta)
- Auto-update is back! For builds after 5.118 you'll be able to use the auto-update and check for update functionality to get new builds.
- Really fixed the Awaken spell so that it only appears once and has the correct book and page. Honestly, I got it this time!
- Removed the alternate Leadership and Arcana skills from 4th Edition.
- Fixed the weapon mounts on the Ares Duelist drone.
- Resolved the error on the Options dialog by setting the Shadowrun 5 sheet as the default if one isn't present.
- Adept powers will now sort by name when you load the character.
- Updated vehicles to allow adding any gear. This resolves several issues... First, being able to replace the standard sensors. Second, until we have vehicle capacity rules, there's really no programmatic means to say what does and does not belong in a car.

Build 5.117 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that could cause a bug while browsing weapons.

Build 5.116 (beta)
- Updated how Limit Modifiers work. In short, there are now two kinds. First, there's those provided by a specific source... for example the Indomitable quality. When you add the quality to or remove the quality from your character, it will automatically add or remove the limit modifier for you. Second, there's custom modifiers. These you add and remove yourself from the Limits tab.  I'm leaving this in place because there's always going to be some limit modifier I've left off and this gives one handy place to view and adjust your modifiers.  Unfortunately this does mean that limit modifiers on existing characters are going to be a problem.  You can however delete the existing limit modifiers, and then remove and re-add the items, qualities, powers, and so on that provide limit modifiers and this will add them back in correctly.
- Added a new Browse feature to the select Weapons and Armor dialogs. In the upper right corner of the dialog, there's a button marked "Browse". If you click it, you'll be shown a grid showing the items belonging to the selected category. You can sort the grid by clicking on the column headers. Otherwise it works the same as the list and you can switch back and forth as you like.
- Added a new Custom Item in Gear under the Custom category.  This item will ask you for a name and a price. You will be charged the amount you specify and the item will take on the name you give it, showing in your inventory as that name.  This should allow for any odd custom or table/campaign specifc item you may need.
- Added the content from Sail Away, Sweet Sister (SASS).
- Added the content from Stolen Souls (SS).
- Added the option to create Prime Runner and Street Level characters.
- Fixed the Demolitions bonus to the Doom mentor spirit.
- Updated the Exceptional Attribute quality to allow selection of Magic and Resonance.
- Fixed the availability calculation for Alpha/Beta/Deltaware for certain pieces of cyber and bioware.
- Removed the Throwing Weapons category from the Select Weapon dialog because these are all purchased as Gear.
- Added priority selection to the Text-Only character sheet.  This information will only appear for new characters created with version 5.116 or later.
- Fixed my own fix for limited spells. When I enabled limited spells to modify the DV of the spell, I accidentally broke the spells with drain greater than their force, for example Element Aura with its F+1 DV. This is now fixed properly.
- Removed the text entry when purchasing reagents.
- In light of the Personalized Grip, various holsters, and Spare Clips, I've updated all weapons to allow accessories. I may in the future add some more specialized handling of weapon accessories to be more specific to the weapon in question but for now this will at least allow usage of standard accessories.  In the end, while it's good if Chummer helps you follow the rules, it shouldn't prevent you from doing something that is legal within the rules.
- Fixed Social Modifiers for Voice Control (power), Tailored Pheromones (bioware), and Sleeping Tiger (armor).
- Fixed the karma costs of Foci during character advancement.
- Removed the Special menu item that would allow you to change your BP as it doesn't really make sense in 5th Edition.
- Reverted The Beast's Way and The Spiritual Way back to costing 20 karma AND added code so that if you have either of these qualities, you will not be charged to add a Mentor Spirit.  In Creation mode, you will be refunded the cost of your Mentor Spirit if you already have one. In Career mode you won't (you've already spent that karma).
- Updated the adept way qualities so that you may only pick one.
- During Career mode and as a Mystic Adept, taking Essence loss sufficient that it reduces your Magic score will also reduce your points allocated to Adept if they exceed your new Magic score.
- Fixed a bug which prevented a cyber weapon from using the Strength of the cyberlimb it is implanted within.
- Added Biotechnology to the Biotech skill group per the errata.
- Fixed Forgery by making it use Logic instead of Agility.
- Updated the character validator to not include the availability of Armor mods marked as "included in base armor" when determining the acceptability of the availability of the character's gear.
- Added Fetishes to Gear in the Magical Supplies category. They have no cost (and per the rules your character must create them) but this addition will enable you to show them in your inventory.
- Fixed a bug causing a character in Creation mode to show their starting nuyen instead of available nuyen on their character sheet.

Build 5.115 (beta)
- Added all of the remaining Street Grimoire content including Toxic Mentor Spirits, Blood Rituals, Insect Shaman tradition, Spirit Champion and Spirit Pariah Qualities, and Magical Items and Compounds.  If you find something that is missing, please let me know.
- Fixed Mentor Spirits with the Improved Ability adept power bonus which were causing a crash.
- Fixed a string bug that would cause a crash on Rituals using an Organic Link descriptor.
- Fixed the Ares Alpha by making its Smartgun System Internal rather than External.
- Fixed the various Cyber Implanted Guns by making their Smartgun System Internal rather than External.
- Fixed an error in the Select an Armor Mod dialog where some items allowed selecting a zero rating.
- Fixed an error in the Select an Armor Mod dialog where some items would cause a crash because they could be given a zero rating.
- Fixed Handheld Housing, Wall-Mounted Housing, Grenade-Cam, and Periscope Cam so that they can be purchased. Once purchased, you should be able to add a single sensor or sensor array (if you have enough capacity) and then populate the single sensor or sensor array with sensor functions. As best as I understand pages 445 and 446, this looks like how this is intended to function.
- Fixed an issue with vehicle sensors. Again, going by pages 445 and 446 and specifically the line "Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats)." I've set the rating of the Sensor Arrays for each vehicle equal to their sensor rating (or 2 if the vehicle/drone has a sensor rating of 1). If I got this wrong, please explain where I went wrong so I can correct it.
- Fixed the calculation for Unarmed Combat damage. Existing characters should delete and re-add their Unarmed Attack on the weapons list.
- Updated the license dialog to suggest more useful options. If you prefer the old method, you can turn it back on in the Options dialog on the Miscellaneous tab.  Either way, you can enter your own values by typing into the dropdown box.  For the XML inclined, you can add your own entries in licenses.xml. If you have suggestions for licenses to be included in the dropdown, send them to me.
- Updated Cool Resolve to provide its bonus to each of the Social skills.
- Fixed several bugs with the Enhanced Accuracy (skill) Adept Power. It was adding to the dice pool in error and not adding to the accuracy of weapons tied to that skill. Both of these issues have been resolved.
- Fixed a bug which would cause a weapon to not benefit from the correct skill.
- Cleaned up the tooltip for Initiative on the Other Information tab.
- Fixed the Matrix Initiative (Cold) calculated value.
- Fixed Limited spells so that they calculate the Drain Value correctly.
- Added 5th Edition Initiative values to the Other Info tab when in Career Mode.
- Removing the One Trick Pony quality will also remove the Martial Art. Removing the One Trick Pony Martial Art will also remove the Quality.

Build 5.114 (beta)
- Renamed the character sheets from "Shadowrun 4" to "Shadowrun 5".  If you're just copying the new version into the same directory, you'll want to delete the files in the \sheets subdirectory named "Shadowrun 4" with the .xsl or .xslt extention.
- Added new book Bullets & Bandages and its contents (BB).
- Fixed a bug that prevented karma from being charged if points were added to Magic in excess of the character's Special Attribute points.
- Updated the cost of The Beast's Way and The Spiritual Way to 15 points to reflect the free mentor spirit these qualities grant.
- Added a discount field below the Bonded Foci listing on the Gear tab that can be used to enter the number of foci qualifying for your Adept Way's foci bonding discount. This was the simplest and most straightforward way to handle the Adept Ways and the foci bonding discounts they might provide.
- Added a new Standard (Burnout's Way) cyberware/bioware grade that is enabled if you take the Burnout's Way quality. It is always available on the Cyberware and Bioware tab on the grade dropdown to handle cases where an Adept had the Burnout's Way, got cyber/bio, and later dropped the Burnout's Way in favor of another Way.
- Fixed a bug preventing the Suprathyroid Gland from increasing your lifestyle costs.
- Fixed Skills and Skill Groups so that if Ignore Rules was selected they cap at 99.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when selecting the Adept power for the Thunderbird Mentor Spirit.
- Fixed several bugs causing errors with the Urban Tribe Tomahawk.
- Fixed an artifact from 4th edition where Chummer was including Martial Arts when calculating the number of points spent on Positve Qualities.
- Fixed the missing Ingram Valiant.
- Fixed Unarmed Attack so that it is automatically added.
- Fixed the price of the SecureTech Vitals Kit.
- Fixed a bug preventing commlinks, rigger command consoles, and cyberdecks from showing on the character sheet. Unfortunately you will need to remove and re-add the item to have it show correctly.
- Updated the "Shadowrun 5" character sheets, cleaning up the skills section slightly to reflect numbers needed in 5th Edition.
- Updated the "Commlinks" character sheet to show Shadowrun 5 specific values. Also now shows Cyberdecks and Rigger Command Consoles.
- Updated the "Vehicle Block" character sheet to show Shadowrun 5 specific values. Also now shows Seats on vehicles added with 5.114 or later versions and Accuracy on vehicle mounted weapons.
- Updated the "Game Master Summary" character sheet to show skill limits, the full set of initiatives, weapon accuracy, and single armor ratings.
- Updated the "Text Only" character sheet to show skill limits, the full set of initiatives, weapon accuracy, and single armor ratings.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing usable ammunition (Grenades, Minigrenades, Missiles, and Rockets) from appearing on the Weapons list.
- Added the missing Minigrenade: Flash-Bang.
- Added the missing Biomonitor to the Urban Explorer Jumpsuit.

Build 5.113 (beta)
- Added a fix to enable backward compatibility in reading characters created before 5.112.

Build 5.112 (beta)
- Added Rituals from Street Grimoire (SG).
- Added Metamagics from SG.
- Added Adept Ways from SG. I've included the discounts but just like Original Chummer, it's up to the player not to take more discounted powers than the 1 per 2 Magic. I will do a 2nd pass on the ways in the near future to restrict the discounts and to take a stab at adding the small bonuses the ways have like the karma discounts that some ways have as well as the cyberware essence discount that the Burnout's Way has and the skill bonus the Beast's Way has. For now, I was happy just getting the discounts working correctly.
- Fixed the price of the Yamaha Growler.
- Enabled the Spells and Spirits tab for Adepts. This allows Adepts to see the stats associated with their Mentor Spirit and to purchase Rituals. I'm currently omitting Rituals with the Spell keyword from the list they can purchase but will change this if it is appropriate to do so. I'm also omitting Rituals with the Adept keyword from the list for Magicians and Aspected Magicians.
- Updated the Add Spell dialog for use by Adepts by restricting selection to Rituals with the Adept keyword.
- Fixed the Taurus Omni-6 so that it gets the Revolver specialization in addition to Automatics.
- Fixed the Enhanced Accuracy Adept Power so that it asks which combat skill to enhance.
- Fixed a bug which allowed characters with more than 25 points in Negative Qualities to validate.
- Fixed a bug with YNT Softweave Armor which would cause it to show more capacity remaining than it should.
- Fixed a bug with broken Skill Groups during character creation not loading correctly from a save file.

Build 5.111 (beta)
- Added Rigger Control Consoles.
- Added a tooltip for weapon Recoil Compensation that shows the sources of RC and their values.
- Fixed Priority D Aspected Magician so that it still requires a skill group selection.
- Fixed a bug that caused an unhandled exception when adding a skill group that includes a skill given free ranks from a priority selection.
- Fixed the Negative Quality Incompetent to require selecting a skill group, not a single skill.
- Fixed the cost of the Positive Quality Strive for Perfection.
- Changed the name of the Natural Immunity qualities to Natural Immunity (Natural) and Natural Immunity (Synthetic). In addition, these qualities are no longer limited to selecting only one of them once.  Whether these should be restricted as such is a GM call.
- Fixed qualities available at multiple ratings so that once that quality is selected at whatever rating, all ratings of that quality no longer appear available for selection.
- Made Resistance to Toxins, Resistance to Pathogens, and Resistance to Pathogens and Toxins mutually exclusive.
- Corrected Positive Quality Agile Defender's karma cost.
- Corrected Positive Quality Resistance to Toxins' karma cost.
- Changed the Positive Qualities Lucky and Exceptional Attribute so that they are no longer compatible.
- Changed the Positive Qualities Rad-Tolerant and Radiation Sponge so that they are no longer compatible.
- Fixed Positive Qualities which grant a bonus to a skill so that they grant that bonus even when defaulting.
- Removed the 4th edition limitation upon skills that limited skill bonuses to half of the skill rating.
- Fixed the Positive Quality Spirit Affinity to require that the character is an Aspected Magician, Magician, or Mystic Adept.

- Fixed the qualities that have ratings (Focused Concentration, High Pain Tolerance, etc...) to be listed in the Select Qualities dialog for each rating value.  Previously it was only allowing you to select the quality once, preventing reaching higher ratings. Unfortunately this means that if you pick Focused Concentration (Rating 2), rating 1 and 3 are still there in the list.  This isn't my optimal fix for this and I'm going to try to find something better. Suggestions are welcome.
- Updated Electrochromic Clothing to be an allowed mod for armor.

- Fixed karma costs for skill groups when buying more than your priority selection grants.
- Fixed karma costs for skills when buying more than your priority selection grants.
- Fixed karma costs for knowledge skills when buying more than your attributes grant. This uses the original code for calculating these costs which forces the player to pay for the most expensive points rather than what might be the most optimal.  As an example, if you have two knowledge skills named A and B and have 6 free knowledge skill points. If you set A at a value of 4 and B at 3, you'll use your 6 free points to raise them each to three and then pay karma to raise A to 4 costing you 4 karma. The optimal path would raise A to 4, B to 2, and then pay karma to raise B to 3 costing you 3 karma.  I've coded everything else (active skills, skill groups, and both primary and special attributes) to use the optimal path for paying karma for items raised beyond what your priorities provide for and wonder if it might be the right thing to do that here as well.
- Fixed character loading so that it loads the total available primary and special attributes per priority selection.

- Fixed an issue where gear standard to a piece of armor wasn't showing up.
- Added the missing Home Ground positive quality.

- Removed the ability to add the Ambidextrous positive quality multiple times (this was a holdover from 4th edition where there was the ability to have more than 2 arms).

Build 490

- fixed an issue where ammoreplace values for Weapons were not being handled correctly
- added an Option on the Miscellaneous tab: Karma cost for increasing Special Attributes is reduced with Essence Loss (see below)

Karma cost for increasing Special Attributes is reduced with Essence Loss
When the option is enabled, the Essence cost to improve MAG or RES is affected by Essence Loss. For example, the character an Essence Penalty of 1 and MAG of 3. Normally, Chummer calculates the cost based on its perceived MAG value of 4 (MAG 4 - Essence Penalty 1 = 3), meaning the cost of improving MAG would be for going from MAG 4 to MAG 5. With this option enabled, Chummer instead calculates the cost based on the shown value of 3, meaning the cost of improving MAG would be for going from MAG 3 to MAG 4. This only impacts Career Mode.

PDF Support
PDF support has been tested with both Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader. Clicking on a sourcebook field (such as SR4 324) will open the linked PDF to the appropriate page. PDF links can be configured in the Options window. There are a few things to note with each application in terms of behaviour. With Adobe Reader, a new instance of the application is opened each time you click on a PDF link in Chummer. If you have the SR4 book open already then click on another SR4 link, a new copy of Adobe Reader is opened to the appropriate page, meaning you will have multiple copies of the SR4 book open at the same time. With Foxit Reader, if you already have the SR4 book open and click on an SR4 link, Foxit Reader will gain focus but will not jump to the appropriate page. Foxit Reader will only jump to the appropriate page if you do not already have a copy of that PDF open. Unfortunately these are not things I can control; they are how these reader applications have been setup to behave.

Relative File Paths for Contacts and Spirits
Contacts and Spirits now support relative file paths for improved portability between computers. Chummer first looks for the exact file name that was linked. If it cannot be found, it falls back to using the relative path that was stored when the save file was linked to it. This will only work with save files that are linked in this and later versions of the application. In order to get this behaviour with previous save files, you will need to remove the link and re-link the save file to the Contact or Spirit.

Free-Style Create Mode
When 0 BP or 0 Karma is entered in the Choose BP Amount window, the Create window now lets you create a character with an unknown amount of BP/Karma. As BP/Karma is spent, the character's point total is automatically calculated. This also tracks the minimum amount of points the character must be based on the Primary Attributes in an attempt to enforce the rule of no more than 1/2 of the character's points total may be spent on Primary Attributes. The BP/Karma field will turn red when the character's Primary Attributes are forcing the character to be calculated at a higher point total than the number of points that have actually been spent.

Donate Button
Enough people have asked for it, so a Donate button has been added to the About window. Please remember that you're not buying a license, the software, or priority support. All donations go towards purchasing additional Shadowrun books as they're released which means more content for Chummer. ;)

Adept Powers that Affect Base Attribute Scores
There has been a rather significant change (correction) to how a few Powers work in terms of affecting Attributes; namely Creative Eye, Improved Physical Attribute, and Keen Wits. The cost of these Powers were not being calculated correctly as they were not correctly modifying their Attributes' actual value, nor were they properly increasing the Karma cost of improving them in Career Mode. If your characters have any of these three Powers, you will need to remove them and re-add them so that things are calculated correctly.

Override Data Files
Similar to Custom Data Files, Override Data Files let you override individual items, replacing the base data with your own version (for example, changing the cost and damage for a Weapon). These follow the same naming rules as Custom Data Files but use "override" as their prefix (such as override_weapons.xml). Multiple Override files can exist for the same type (such as multiple Override files for Weapons), and the files are loaded in alphabetical order after loading the base data files. The item in the Override file completely replaces the base item. This is not intended to be used for holding your new custom data as the XML Manager will only overwrite existing items; it will not add items that do not exist in the base data files. Use at your own risk.

Settings Files
Chances are, most people are just going to stick with the default one and modify it as needed. For those who take part in multiple games where the sourcebooks allowed and optional rules used varies, you can create additional Settings files to keep all of this information separate. To create a new Setting, copy the default.xml file in the settings directory, rename the new copy to whatever you like, then modify it using the Options window. When you create a new character, Chummer asks you which Setting you would like to use (if more than 1 file exists). The name Settings file used is saved as part of the character file. You can change the Settings file a character uses by opening the save file in a text editor and changing the <settings /> tag to match the name of the desired file. These files can be given to players to make sure that everyone has the same set of options enabled.

About Omae
Omae is an online character repository where players and GMs can upload their creations to share with others who are looking for Contacts, Enemies, and Critters for their games. Anyone can download characters, but you must have a registered Omae account in order to upload characters. Registration is required so that people can see who put the effort into the character, search for other creations by that person, as well as allowing only the author to update a revised version of the character or delete it entirely. Registration is free and only asks for a user name and password. No other information is asked for or recorded. I have no use for that stuff. Password are encoded and stored in the online database. You may also choose to save your user name and password information locally so that you can log into Omae automatically when you open the window. Password are stored in an encoded format within the Windows Registry along with the other Chummer settings. When a character is downloaded, it is saved to your [Chummer path]\saves\omae directory.

Expense Undo Entries
This will be an ongoing project. By right-clicking on a Karma or Nuyen Expense, you can choose to undo the purchase. This will only be for Expenses that were created during the current session. They will not be saved with your character information, so once you have closed the character, the undo history is lost (largely to prevent undoing something done 10 game sessions ago without undoing anything else). Currently supported items - Karma: Attribute, Karma: Add Quality, Nuyen: Cyberware/Bioware, Nuyen: Gear. This only undoes the expense for the item you have selected. If you later added child items you should undo these expenses first - the undo function strictly undoes the single item that is selected, meaning anything that was added after and not undone will not be refunded. This is intended to undo your most recent few transactions only.

Free Spirit Characters
Magic replaces Force since they are the same Attribute for the Free Spirit. When you first create a Free Spirit character, your Attribute BP total will be very high but is technically correct. All of the character's Attribute start at 2 and have a Metatype Maximum of 2 (the Free Spirit's starting Force/Magic). This means that all of your Attribute costs are being calculated at their Metatype Maximum which adds +15BP per Attribute. (This technically breaks all of the other written rules saying only 1 Physical/Mental Attribute can be at it's Metatype Maximum.) When MAG 3 or higher is selected, this number drops back down since they are all no longer at their Metatype Maximum. (And who would play a Force 2 Free Spirit anyways?)

A.I. Characters
Resonance replaces Rating. Their free Programs can be purchased through Gear by selecting the Free! checkbox when purchasing.

- Elemental Strike and Elemental Resistance Adept Powers now ask for a value to be selected
- <specificattribute /> Improvements now include support for precedence attribute which determines how they stack with other Improvements to the same Attribute (see below)

specificattribute precedence
This has been included to (and should only be used for) Cyberware, Bioware, and Powers that affect Initiative and/or Reaction which either does not allow it to stack with any other enhancement, or only certain ones. A precedence of 1 ignore all other Improvements and uses the COMBINED value of all other precedence 1 items (Wired Reflexes, Move-by-Wire, and Reaction Enhancers). A precedence of 0 ignore all other Improvements and uses the single highest precedence 0 Improvement the character has (Synaptic Booster). Short version: nothing you need to actually worry about - the necessary items have already been updated and Chummer figures out what it should use. :)

The code to convert these Qualities will be removed around June 20 (update notes will be posted to inform of the change). Qualities are now handled like other items in that they can be added/removed using the Add and Delete buttons and are listed in a single tree.

Custom Data Files
You can create custom data for each of the data files. To being, create a copy of an existing file and add "custom_" to its name. For example, to create custom Cyberware date, you would create a copy of cyberware.xml and rename it custom_cyberware.xml. This will give you the structure that the application expects. You can then create your custom items using the custom data file. The <version> information can be safely removed since it does not apply. Your custom information will be shown along with the application's own data where applicable.
