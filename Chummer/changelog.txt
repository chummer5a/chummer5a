Future Build 217
Application Changes:
- Adding a new non-advanced lifestyle that is eligible for Trust Fund no longer causes a crash. Fixes #4601.
- Adding a plugin to a custom cyberweapon no longer causes a crash.
- Cyberware limited by the number of limbs is now not affected by detached modular limbs.
- Tooltips breaking down a character's total armor now properly recognize when certain sources of armor have been made invalid.

- Adept Powers, AI Programs, Metamagic Arts, Complex Forms, Critter Powers, Mentor Spirits, Metamagics, Spells, and Weapon Mounts should now automatically fetch notes from linked PDFs.
- Mugshot compression settings should now properly get saved with other global settings.
- Added an option to have Chummer automatically set the lossy compression quality for mugshots in save files instead of using the same, manually defined setting for all images. Using this automatic setting, larger images will be saved with lower Jpeg quality settings because Jpeg artifacts will be less visible in them, while smaller images get saved with higher quality settings.
- If the prompt asking the user if they wish to automatically apply a Chummer updater is dismissed, it no longer re-appears until the user has closed and later re-opened Chummer.

- Qualities can no longer mysteriously disappear but still leave behind their bonuses when changing priorities.
- Settings in the Character Settings menu are now properly updated when the settings selection is changed. Fixes #4620.

- Cyberarms and modular shoulder arms can now interact properly with Shiva Arms 2.
- Encumbrance penalties to Agility that are greater than the attribute's base value no longer artificially lower the character's average Agility when they also have cyberlimbs. Fixes #4625.

- Fixed character types (NPCs, critters) that are given a skill on creation incorrectly being provided with an empty Specialisation
- Dealer Connection's discount is now properly shown and processed for non-drones in the vehicle selection screen. Fixes #4616.

- Vehicles now output whether or not they are drones when exporting.
- Data about characters' mentor spirit(s) and/or paragon(s) are now printed when exporting.
- Mentor spirit and paragon advantages and disadvantages are now properly translated when save files are opened in a different language than what was set when the mentor spirit or paragon in question was added to a character.
- Fixed crashes caused by discrepancies between character settings and the system that oversees their management. Fixes #4626.
- Dealer Connection and Black Market Pipeline no longer retroactively adjust prices in Career mode. Fixes #4617.
- Items bought with a Black Market Pipeline discount in Create mode no longer retain their discount if Black Market Pipeline is removed or changed to a different category.
- Fixed priority choices that remove metavariants not working correctly due to metavariants being populated from metatypes.xml instead.

- Tweaked Dark Mode colors to be darker for brighter colors and lighter for darker colors.
- Weapon mounts that come with a vehicle can no longer have their parameters (size, flexibility, visibility, and control) adjusted in the weapon mounts screen. Partial fix for #4648.
- Built-in modifications to built-in weapon mounts no longer take up slots inside the weapon mount or contribute to its overall costs.
- When modifying a weapon mount, changing its Visibility no longer causes its old Visibility value to be kept and have its availability and slot modifiers applied. Fixes #4648.
- Adding a quality that is suppressed by something that is already on the character now properly disables the quality's effects.
- Mastery Qualities bought with spell points now properly contribute to the positive quality karma limit. Fixes #4654.
- Skill group labels' tooltips that show the skills in the given skill group now work properly again.
- Checking the "Free" box when creating a weapon mount is now reversible, meaning that editing the mount and unchecking the box properly makes the mount not-free again.
- Weapon mounts are now properly included in Chummer's calculations for if vehicles have too many used weapon slots or nots.
- When adding a new weapon mount in Career mode, messages about not having enough money and/or enough capacity for the created weapon mount now occur before the weapon mount creation window is closed instead of after, allowing users to remedy their mistakes without recreating the entire weapon mount a second time.
- The character roster's Recent Characters list no longer gets doubly populated by entries that also exist in the Favorite Characters list whenever a character from that list is opened or closed. Fixes #4565.
- Underbarrel weapons that come with their parent weapon now properly automatically inherit any smartgun features that also come built into their parent weapon. Fixes #4662.
- Added a basic implementation of search for metatypes and critters using Point Buy. This will later be extended to include Priority options. Implements #4546
- Drain expressions now properly show their translated names.

- When adding bonuses or improvements that disable cyberware and/or bioware, characters no longer get their Essence Holes, Antiholes, and modular cyberlimbs deleted.
- Armor costs now properly support "FixedValues()" entries.
- Cybersuites that add cyberlimbs now properly incorporate those cyberlimbs' attributes into the character's overall attributes.
- Added a browser view for vehicles to show content in a grid view, similar to the weapons browser. Currently a bit slow.

- Fixed various issues caused by interactions between bonuses/improvements that add special skills and custom rulesets that can alter special skills lists.

Data Changes:

- String_Initializing_Pattern

Build 215
Application Changes:
- Added a Scan Folder for PDF Sourcebooks to Options, so that (to Chummer known) Sourcebooks are automatically found and indexed.
- Fixed a lot of buggy behavior related to opening characters with Chummer from outside the program (e.g. with Windows' "Open with..." function).
- Clicking on "Open PDF" on a Master Index entry with no associated pdf now opens the "Choose PDF" Dialog instead of doing nothing.
- Fixed a crash when Custom Date and/or Time Formats were set to an empty value.
- Added the ability for devs to set an action when a user double clicks on an entry in the character roster.
- Added the upload of a crash to ApplicationInsights in parallel to the old Crashhandler (Loglevelfilters still apply)
- Properly split apart settings that can be different for individual characters (e.g. karma costs, enabled sourcebooks, enabled custom data) and those that cannot (e.g. PDF paths, UI language, dark mode). The old Options screen now controls the latter, while the former can be managed through a separate, dedicated screen.
- Settings files that were created for previous versions of Chummer will automatically be converted to character-based settings that use a new format. Characters created for previous versions of Chummer will have their specific entries for certain settings (e.g. character creation karma costs, enabled sourcebooks) converted as well. However, these two changes mean that once settings and/or characters are saved in this version of Chummer, they cannot be opened (properly) with older versions. The Nightlies will therefore show a one-time warning about using the Nightly when one might plan to go back and open up characters with the latest stable (or an earlier build).
- Properly unhardcoded Sum-to-Ten costs for each priority category. They can now be modified with custom data files.
- Attempting to add an exotic skill no longer causes Chummer to crash. Fixes #4329.
- The "Free" checkbox under Contacts no longer remains visible after collapsing a contact control in Career mode.
- If a character has purchased qualities at character creation that require certain metatypes or metavariants, then instead of the character being restricted from changing their priorities and/or metatype, those qualities now automatically get removed if the character can no longer have them.
- Characters are no longer stuck in the build method that was chosen when they were first created.
- The exported English names of qualities no longer contain the quality's rating (which made it behave differently than the regular name).
- Purchasing a plugin for a stack of gear with more than one item now properly multiplies the expenditure of the purchase by the size of the stack.
- Fixed issues where cyberlimbs and modular connectors would not properly block competing modular connectors.
- If Chummer is unable to update registry entries, it will now display a warning that it cannot update registry entries instead of crashing.
- Cancelling out of number- or text-selection screens when adding some piece of gear, cyberware, weapon, armor, vehicle, lifestyle, or any modifications thereof now properly cancels out of adding the original item.
- Removed checkboxes for active skills and knowledge skills from the PACKS creator because Chummer's PACKS system does not properly support either.
- Wireless bonuses now properly respect the wireless status of any parents of a given item (e.g. gear inside of armor or cyberware inside other cyberware) as well as their equipped status. Fixes #4351.
- Quotation marks in the names of spells, qualities, critter powers, adept powers, cyberware, et al. or any categories thereof should no longer cause Chummer to either crash or not recognize the item in question.
- Special attributes are no longer exported unless the character in question has them enabled. Fixes #4366.
- When using Chummer in a non-English language, the way custom text is recorded and translated is now slightly smarter about which translation to use when one English word has multiple different translations. Fixes #4378.
- Deleting a quality with multiple levels after character creation now properly deletes all levels of the quality instead of only one. Fixes #4367.
- The translator tool now only inserts a "translated" attribute into a language file if the user manual marks an entry that is identical to its English text as translated. Any entries that are different from their English counterparts no longer get the "translated" attribute.
- Added buttons to the (global) options screen that let the user clear the entries for the character roster path, the PDF program path, and any PDF file paths.
- Added the ability to track sustained spells and complex forms in the Career mode. They are found in their respective tabs. Psyche is also supported, as are bonus nodes that allow a certain number of spells or complex forms up to a certain force or level to be sustained without penalties.
- Added the ability to specify a city, district, and borough for a lifestyle.
- If a character sheet is printed/exported in a language other than the one with which Chummer is being used, Chummer now attemtps to translate the names of gear, vehicle, and weapon locations.
- Generating character sheets in languages where commas are used as decimal separators and/or periods are used as number group separators no longer sometimes causes the generator to stall out and silently crash. Fixes #4415.
- When saving a character as created, the starting nuyen screen now allows the user to select which lifestyle to use for generating their starting nuyen. It now also includes a Cancel button and a button for automatically rolling dice for the chosen lifestyle.
- Closing out the starting nuyen screen no longer causes weird issues with the character's saved Nuyen or saved Karma and also no longer prompts the user to save a created character.
- Fixed life modules button not being visible in create mode.
- Critter power karma costs are now properly retained when loading a saved character.
- Enhanced use of weapondetails to allow using it in allof, oneof or group nodes.
- Characters who are forced to have some non-special attributes at zero (e.g. those with Quadriplegic) can now properly have a non-zero attribute at its maximum rating at character creation. They can also now properly learn skills linked to the forced-zero attribute(s), but their pools will always be zero when using that attribute.
- Saving a character in Create mode as Created when they were never saved beforehand no longer causes the character to be saved with them still in Create mode.
- Checkboxes in the options menus now properly respond to being set to Dark Mode. Fixes #4438.
- When calculating the karma value of a character in Priority or Sum-to-Ten, the karma amount displayed for comparison to Point Buy now uses the Point Buy costs for the character's metatype instead of the value of their combined attribute adjustments and qualities.
- Added the ability to manually set Chummer's display scaling method in the Global Options screen, though a restart is required to see any changes. The default display scaling method is now also Zoom (i.e. System) instead of Rescale (i.e. PerMonitorV2).
- For mentor spirits that do not allow the user to select from multiple bonuses, the entire bonus is now shown as regular text instead of it being cut off in a grayed-out dropdown box.
- Custom data directories can now implement a manifest.xml files to serve as an explanation for the custom data. This explanation is also displayed in the Custom Data Directory selection. This .xml can also hold additional information about the author, version or dependencies/exclusivities. For details see chummer/customdata/manifest.xsd
- Trust Fund can now be selected for non-advanced lifestyles.
- Skill pool tooltips no longer sometimes show the skill's category as its specialization.
- Spell and Complex Form pool tooltips are no longer combine the contribution of their linked attribute and their linked skill.
- Spells and Complex Forms with special damage amounts, targets, and/or ranges now have those translated properly when printing/exporting in a non-English language.
- In order to prevent users from thinking Chummer has locked up when it is still working, Chummer now shows a visible loading progress bar when it is loading in a character's UI elements or when it is saving a character.
- The dice roller no longer crashes when a user re-rolls failures while having more hits than initial dice (due to enabling Rule of 6).
- When using Chummer in a non-English language, contact controls will no longer attempt to immediately translate and then re-translate the contents of text fields after every single possible change. Fixes #4450.
- Gear that can act as ammunition without being in the ammunition category is now properly treated as such when exporting character information, printing sheets, or buying more ammo. Fixes #4457.
- Attempting to add a weapon to a weapon mount that cannot mount any weapons no longer crashes Chummer. Fixes #4448.
- Skill groups now show when they have been disabled by an improvement such as Uncouth.
- A crash that would sometimes occur when Chummer is restarted programmatically has been resolved.
- Upgrading cyberware or bioware to have both a different rating and a different grade at the same time can no longer cause a character's special attributes to get decreased from Essence loss mid-upgrade unless the final essence cost of the 'ware is actually greater enough than the old cost.
- Print method now ignores control characters when printing to the Sheet Export window.
- The Control Device pool for a weapon is now properly AGI-based instead of LOG-based, as the core rulebook dictates.
- Changing a vehicle-mounted weapon's firing mode now properly updates the selectable box for firing modes instead of keeping it blank.
- Metatype selection screens now contain a label referencing the sourcebook location of the currently selected metatype. Implements #4357.
- The priority selection screen can now properly deal with potential custom priority entries with spirits and/or sprites.
- Vehicle and Cyberware Condition Monitor controls now work properly. Fixes #4449.
- Cyberware and vehicles now export the amount that their Matrix Condition Monitors are filled. Weapons now properly export all of their Matrix-related properties, including their Matrix attributes and their Matrix Condition Monitor status.
- Deleting a skill by undoing the Karma expense for adding it now properly deletes the skill instead of lowering its rating by 1. Fixes #4323.
- Fixed an issue that prevented 'ware with a capacity of 0 from having any gear added to it, even ones that are explicitly allowed. Fixes #4228.
- Fixed an issue that some specific skills were not shown for critters based on a Force selection
- Added an option to assign a color to each note to allow a way to categorize notes.
- Data entries that directly use attribute values (e.g. for damage codes) now all require the abbreviations of those attributes to be enclosed in curly brackets, e.g. {STR}. They now also all support using unaugmented attribute values by adding "Unaug" after the attribute name but before the end of the curly brackets, as well as "base" attribute values (i.e. those given by priority entries only) by adding "Base" after the attribute abbreviation the same way.
- When determining dice pools for weapons, having a specialization in the specific weapon name is now always enough to give the appropriate dice pool bonus. In the case of exotic skills, this means an exotic skill in the specific weapon is enough. Fixes #4467.
- Fixed some weird behavior that might happen when trying to open a Chummer save file before opening Chummer first.
- The karma cost of fettering a spirit is no longer hardcoded.
- Attempting to buy a cyberlimb accessory for a non-Adapsin, non-Standard grade cyberlimb after having bought Adapsin no longer causes the accessory's grade to be set to Standard (Adapsin).
- Added the ability to re-attempt connecting to GitHub inside the Updater tool.
- Using custom date formats no longer causes the Nuyen and Karma expenses lists to be sorted incorrectly. Fixes #4472.
- Using and regaining Edge no longer affects modifiers to the value of the Edge attribute. Instead, spent Edge is tracked purely on its own and is printed/exported separately as `edgeused` and `edgeremaining` for spent Edge and remaining Edge respectively. Character sheets now properly display the amount of Edge remaining for a character in the attributes section.
- Weapons added to a vehicle mount no longer disappear after editing said vehicle mount.
- First-time Chummer users who download a Nightly version now have their "Prefer Nightly Version" option set to True by default instead of False. Only completely new users (i.e. people who do not have a Chummer registry key) are affected.
- Cyberprograms, Software, Autosofts, et al. are now properly recognized as programs and printed as such.
- A vehicle weapon mount that comes pre-installed with a vehicle but whose size is from a splatbook that the character does not have enabled now still show up as weapon mounts. However, their sizes are shown as one of the core rulebook weapon mount sizes: Heavy if it can fit heavy weapons, Standard otherwise. Fixes #4477.
- Chummer no longer allows more than one unbound spirit or sprite on a character at a time, but now also only cares about unbound and unfettered spirits and sprites that have at least one service in their entry.
- In Create mode, gear can now be pasted into armor mods and armor, and armor mods can now be pasted into armor.
- Weapons that use External Source ammo now have External Source properly recognized as one of the options with which the weapon can be loaded.
- In the character roster tool, saves that are present both in the Watch folder and in either the Favorites or Recents lists now also still show up in the Watch folder section.
- Extended versions of Detection spells that are explicitly allowed by RAW no longer erroneously have drain codes of 2 higher than normal.
- Picking an exotic skill as a skill in which to get free levels from a Priority selection now works properly and adds the selected exotic skill to the character's skill list at the specified level.
- Improvements that alter the number of power points available to a character now properly cause power point totals in the Adept Powers tab to be updated with new values. This includes metamagics that add power points.
- When Chummer is opened, it now tries to automatically detect if there is an autosave for a character that could have been an unsaved character otherwise lost by Chummer crashing or exiting unsafely. If it finds such an autosave, it prompts the user if they want to load said autosave.
- Chummer now attempts to delete all autosaves older than 90 days that are not linked to any Favorite or Most Recently Used character.
- Improvements and qualities that affect the linked attribute of a skill now have their effects properly reflected in the UI all the time.
- Closing an opened character that is also not the currently viewed character in the program no longer causes the tool strip of icons at the top to misbehave.
- Qualities with levels taken at only level 1 now display their level as "1" instead of not displaying any level.
- When removing content that has added potentially duplicate specializations to a character, the specialization that was added by said content is now properly always gets removed.
- A warning is now shown when attempting to open enough characters that it might cause Chummer to silently crash.
- Added a plural/singular detector to the code that checks if a character has a specialization for a weapon.
- Added the ability to add spells and complex forms to a character through the Improvements system in career mode.
- Armor items classified as Clothing but without a + or - in their armor codes are now treated as regular armor instead of armor extras.
- Qualities with a rating can now be added at higher ratings from the quality selector, and the quality selector's karma filters now also take qualities with multiple ratings into account.
- In Create mode, the sidebar section that tracks the number of spells, rituals, and preparations learned with priority points now properly reflects the maximum number of each as points are spent in either of the other categories.
- Added support for Cyberware using the 'sameparent' requirement, in the same manner as armor mods. This allows for checking if the parent of a piece of cyberware (ie cyberlimb) already has another piece of cyberware installed.
- Armor and clothing are now marked as devices with Matrix attributes.
- Split up the option for how much Nuyen is gained per Karma spent after character creation into separate Working for the Man and Working for the People values.
- Weapon mounts for vehicles now have their capacities for weapons explicitly defined. The default size is one weapon, but a different size can be set with the weaponsize parameter. Users can no longer attempt to add more weapons to a mount than it has capacity for weapons.
- Bonus nodes and improvements that force characters to pick up certain metamagics/echoes at specific initiation/submersion grades now properly allow the character to pick up other metamagics/echoes at other grades. Fixes #4530.
- AP and weapon damage codes that contain a slash mark that is not meant to represent a division operation can now be shown properly. In order to prevent ambiguity with slash marks that do represent a division operation, two successive slash marks need to be used to identify a forward slash mark that is not meant to be a division operation. Fixes #4532.
- Using "Touch" instead of "T" for range now still properly translates a spell's or critter power's range to the equivalent in non-English languages. Fixes #4544.
- Modifications that come with a vehicle weapon mount are now marked as such.
- Black Market Pipeline's discount can now be applied to weapon mounts and can now be toggled freely during character creation. Fixes #4553.

- Fixed the handling of weapons with depletable charges not working properly with Chummer's reload button and ammo handling.
- Fixed a rare crash that would happen when Chummer tried handling certain texts that contained nothing but spaces.
- For improvements that add a quality of the user's choice, requirements for qualities are now properly processed. Fixes #4567.
- Added support for Cyberware plugins that add a weapon accessory to their parent weapon, i.e. the Overclocked upgrade for a Shock Hand. Adding the plugin will now add the relevant accessory to the added weapon.
- Added support for customising the calculation of bound spirit and registered sprite limits as a house rule.
- Fixed category display not working correctly when searching for items in frmSelectGear. Closes #4570
- Non-retroactive essence modifiers are now properly non-retroactive.
- Merged <restrictedgearitemcount> bonus node functionality into <restrictedgear> bonus nodes so that the latter can now support multiple allowed availabilities and different quantities for each allowed availability.
- Restricted Gear can now properly handle cases where multiple items exceeding character creation availability limits are in one stack instead of split across multiple ones.
- Fixed Smartsoft behaviour for drone-controlled weapon dicepools not being properly calculated. 
- Enemies as per 4th edition rules now need to be enabled through the House Rules tab in character settings. Settings for the amount of karma gained from enemies are now clearly delineated and grouped together in the House Rules tab. Fixes #1325.
- Favorite characters are now always automatically sorted alphabetically by their file paths. Fixes #3853.
- Having Chummer not round Essence internally no longer allows characters with exactly 0 Essence to be valid.
- LimittSpellCategory improvement can now exclude a category from being selected.
- Objects can now use the presence of skills with total ranks (ie a total rank of 4 or more for Firearms + Blades) using the skilltotal node for required/forbidden operations. 
- Added the ability to export characters while still in character creation. Fixes #4585.
- Added support for using a category of cyberware for forbidden/required nodes. Uses the cyberwarecategory and biowarecategory element names. For example, to require that a quality only be taken if the user has a cyberware in the Cyber Implant Weapon category, you would use <cyberwarecategory>Cyber Implant Weapon</cyberwarecategory>
- Added weaponrangemodifier bonus type. This can be used to alter the range penalty for a given weapon. The bonus follows the form of <weaponrangemodifier><name>[contains]Partial Weapon Name</name><value>1</value></weaponrangemodifier>. Note that name is optional, and it does not need to use the [contains] tag. If name is not specified, all weapons will be modified. 

Data Changes:
- Consolidated all German Data Changes custom data and all German-exclusive content of sourcebooks printed in English into a single German Data Changes custom data folder.
- Individualized Alchemy, Disenchanting, Power, and Spellcasting focuses now properly apply their bonuses. Existing characters with these focuses will need to re-add them or reapply improvements to see any changes. Fixes #4340.

- Smartlink from the Shadowrun 2050 ruleset now properly gives a +2 dicepool bonus when using smartguns.
- When creating spirit critters with forces not divisible by 3, the number of optional powers they get is now properly based on rounding the result of the division down instead of up. Fixes #4356.

- Fixed a typo in Baseline Reagents' availability. Fixes #4458.
- All French translations that contain a shortened article (i.e. "d'" or "l'") now have zero-width spaces between the consonant and the apostrophe in order to prevent weirdness with the way they are sorted alphabetically. Searching without a zero-width space should still work, however.
- Chemical Glands can now hold Chemicals and Custom Drugs.

- The Morgan Cutlass' weapon mounts now properly use the newer system of dedicated weapon mount types instead of vehicle mods.
- Vestigial remains of the old, vehicle mod-based weapon mount system have been purged.

- The Krime Euskaldunak Tankette now uses Rigger 5.0 weapon mounts if Rigger 5.0 is enabled.
- There are now dedicated options for weapon mount options that are for the weapon mounts that are statted out in the core rulebook. Fixes #4493.

- Added Stock, Side, Underbarrel, and Top weapon accessory slots to assault cannons, grenade launchers, and missile launchers that were missing it.

Build 214
Application Fixes:
- Added a check for xml files storing invalid characters that prevents the file from being saved or loaded. As test issues have been constrained to issues with the notes, it's assumed that this is mostly coming from ingesting PDF documents. If the issue is found, prompt the user whether they want to load with unsafe settings, as this has a small chance of causing application instability. 
- Added safeguard to notes save method to prevent them from storing said invalid characters. 
- Characters with MAG attributes but who are neither magicians nor adepts of any kind no longer have their MAG attribute disappear in Career mode when the optional rule to have Mystic Adepts use a second MAG attribute is enabled.
- Dark mode's darkened backgrounds have been made slightly lighter (by up to 20%).
- Fixed an issue where some sourcebooks would insert ligature characters into an item's notes that Chummer could not handle and would prevent the character from being saved and/or crash whenever the character was opened.
- When loading a character from a save file, the program now automatically checks if there are any saves in the autosave folder that seem to match the currently loading save file's character and that have a later last write date and time than those of the currently loading save file. If it finds such an autosave, it now prompts the user of whether they want to load the autosave instead, though if they do, the old save file will not be altered until they manually save, just in case they realize that the autosave is not what they want after it has been loaded.
- Characters with all but one skill disabled in a skill group no longer have their only enabled skill's rating show up as their rating for that skill group.
- Characters can now properly learn free spells in Career mode even if they do not have enough spare Karma to be able to learn said spells traditionally.
- In Career mode, if the optional rule to not double positive quality karma costs is not set, the karma filters in the quality selection form now properly consider the doubled cost of qualities that are not set to not double their costs after character creation.
- Upgrading cyberware that is a part of another piece of cyberware no longer causes the cyberware selector form to display an empty list.
- Mastery qualities that are not purchased traditionally no longer deduct free spell points.
- Chummer now properly registers attempts to join a technomancer network/tribe in Career mode.
- Improvements that add gear without a rating no longer add that gear with a rating of 1.
- Armor against special types of damage now properly work off of the highest total armor rating against that particular damage type instead of taking the highest generic armor rating and adding the highest special type armor bonus to it. Fixes #4253.
- Settings for which ammo types can be used for which weapon types have been unhardcoded. The `ammoforweapontype` tag in gear items now dictates if said gear item can be used as ammo for a certain type of weapon, with the attribute 'noextra="True"' intended to be set where the ammo can broadly serve in all weapons of that type instead of just one specific one. The "type" attribute in a weapon's category dictates its default weapon type, though it can be overriden with a "weapontype" node inside the weapon's definition.
- Lifestyle notes now properly show up after a new lifestyle is added.
- If there are multiple orphaned improvements that used to have the same parent, these are now properly detected as orphaned improvements.
- Characters no longer have extra special attributes burned when they buy new 'ware whose fractional part of its essence cost combined with the size of the character's existing essence hole would add up to more than one.
- Upgrading 'ware no longer shifts a character's essence in the opposite direction to where it is supposed to (i.e. increasing character Essence if the new piece has a greater Essence cost than the old piece, decreasing character Essence if the new piece has a lesser Essence cost than the old piece).
- Negative fractional improvement values are now always rounded away from zero instead of always towards zero.
- Added support for maxrating on armor mods exceeding the rating of the base item. Supports Bunker Gear Fire Resistance 8
- Reapplying improvements no longer causes drain/fading-related labels to stop reflecting changes in attributes.
- Fixed the Increased Seating mod not correctly rounding up when used on vehicles with 1 Seat.
- Notes copied in from PDFs are less likely to have line breaks in weird places, like after commas or semicolons.
- Critter definitions where inherent critter power, inherent gear, and/or natural weapon stats are based on the critter's force no longer cause Chummer to crash.
- Gear that is added to an armor mod now properly has its parent set to said armor mod, fixing various issues like being unable to delete gear added to an armor mod.
- The Export screen's preview window no longer displays a preview of the Base64 strings used to store raw image data for mugshots, which should speed up the function considerably.
- The English names of a character's skills are now also exposed upon exporting said character.
- Custom improvements for adding echoes and metamagics to a character have been added.
- The Source label in the weapon mount creation screen is now properly clickable.
- Vehicle mod costs, availabilities, and slot capacity requirements can now use their parent vehicles' Armor, Sensor, and Pilot ratings.
- Special whitespace characters necessary for certain languages, e.g. non-breaking spaces in French or zero-width spaces in hyphenated English, are no longer automatically converted to standard, single-width spaces in characters' notes.
- Armor, Vehicle, Vehicle Mod, Weapon, and Spell selection screens no longer show categories that have no selectable items (usually if the character does not have the necessary books enabled).
- Adding Gear directly to locations now works properly.
- Restricted Gear for weapons and/or vehicles that are added by other items no longer counts both the source item and the weapon/vehicle itself as two separate items.
- Fixed Fettering not being properly allowed for Magicians.
- Items and improvements that disable specialization bonuses for a skill, e.g. Loss of Confidence, now properly disable them.
- The dice roller now properly shows updated results after rerolling misses. Fixes #4305.
- Dropdown boxes in non-English languages now properly display their localized texts and sort by them instead of showing and sorting by English values. Fixes #4319.
- Fixed an issue in the amend system where if multiple parent nodes were being modified at once with the option to add a node if it is not found, having that node present in only one parent would prevent it from being added to all the parents that were missing it. Fixes a bug that was mentioned off-handedly in #4310.
- The message for removing or downgrading a quality in Career mode now properly includes the quality's name and the cost of removing it.
- Added support for save files having a minimum version of Chummer defined. This will be used in a near-future version of Chummer that contains a significant enough change to the structure of character saves that it will need it.
- The export tool can now export in languages other than the one in which Chummer is currently being used.
- Fixed an issue where character sheets exported in a different language than Chummer's current language still have their metatype and metavariant texts set based on the language that Chummer is using.

Data Changes:
- The Ares Light Fire 75's suppressor is no longer incorrectly referred to as the Ares Light Fire 70's suppressor.
- Added a new PDF Parameter option that is Adobe Acrobat-style, but always opens a new instance of the clicked file.
- Linguistics (the adept power) no longer increases a character's native language limit by 1.
- Amended Bunker Gear to properly get rating 8 Fire Resistance instead of rating 6.
- Limited Skill Autosofts to the skills listed in Rigger 5. 
- Added Skill Autosoft (Knowledge) per Rigger 5.
- Fixed Orks Have Natural Weapon Tusks customdata to provide Tusks instead of Horns.
- Fixed Ares Duelist not getting targeting autosoft
- Fixed Climate Adaptation and Proboscis metagenic qualities not having the correct flag. Closes #4278
- Added previously missing entries for the Proteus Krake's micro-torpedos and micro-torpedo launcher. Existing saves containing a Proteus Krake will have its previously buggy weapon mount entry replaced with a functional one that properly includes the micro-torpedo launcher.
- Added KEV toxin from Shadowrun Missions Season 8. Added SRM8 book.
- Removed the Advanced Ritual Casting requirement from Attune Item and Empower rituals. Closes #4277
- Added separate [Custom Cyberdeck] Firewall gear item for Fuchi Cyber-N.
- Corrected a few mentor spirit bonus texts that did not have spaces after colons.
- Added customdata to allow the weapon mounts from Rigger 5 to mount Sporting Rifles. Closes #4287
- Added Barehanded Adept to quality whitelist for Focused Concentration. Closes #4293
- Fixed incorrect liner categories for the Ares Victory line. Closes #4299
- Fixed incorrect weapon types for underbarrel grenade launchers that prevent them from being reloaded properly. Closes #4297
- Helmets in the custom ruleset "Helmets Are Mods, SWAT and MilSpec Are FBA" now properly have capacities for gear instead of negative armor capacities.
- Rigger 5.0 attribute increase drone mods now properly consume slot points based on the increase instead of on the total rating. The first level of an attribute increase (the first three for armor) are not also properly free.
- Weapons that come with Trigger Removal as default no longer get an extra +1 Accuracy compared to their printed statblocks.
- In Priority-based creation, Apprentices now get the same skill group extras that Aspected Magicians get, though they cannot choose the Enchanting skill group because those skills are forbidden for Apprentices. Fixes #4313.
- The customdata for letting Rigger 5.0 Standard and Heavy vehicle mounts to sporting rifles now works for proper Rigger 5.0-style weapon mounts as well. Fixes #4289.
- Fixed incorrect stats for Krime Trollbow Horns.
- Fixed incorrect specializations for various Carbines from Street Lethal.
- Removed Hardened Rolling Blades weapon, as No Future says that Rolling Blades are only available in Bladed form.
- Carbines is now one of the recommended specializations for the Automatics skill.
- Added customdata that removes Automatics as a skill, placing Machine Pistols into the Pistols skill and all other Automatics weapons into the Longarms skill. Heavy Weapons replaces Automatics in the Firearms skill group. Implements #4310.
- Evo Sublime now properly is only available as an implanted cyberdeck.
- Fixed the cost of integrated synthlinks and internal SmartCams.

Build 213
Application Fixes:
- Added a limited dark mode. The mode can be set and previewed in the Options menu. For existing users, Chummer will default to Light mode; for new users, Chummer will default to automatically checking the setting in Windows for whether apps should run in Light or Dark mode.
- Fixed an incorrect tag on submersion groups in career mode. 
- Fixed incorrect default multiplier for Technomancer Ordeals/Tasks. 
- Fixed a crash when changing priority selection if the character has FreeSpellsSkill improvements (ie Dedicated Spellslinger).
- Fixed a regression in career mode not allowing Initiation Groups to be joined or left properly. Closes #4115
- Fixed a myriad of cases where printing a character sheet in a language that is different from the language being used for the program would sometimes result in incorrect localization and/or number formats being used.
- Fixed qi foci improperly providing free levels of a power rather than free points. Closes #4116
- Qualities that unlock special skills are no longer all always effectively free when purchased traditionally.
- Amend files now default to not adding missing nodes by default unless no amendoperation is specified and the amend node has no children (i.e. default amendoperation would be "replace"). This generally makes amends with very general filters work properly again.
- In an Amend file, if a "recurse" node is set to not add itself if no target is found, it will still recurse into the amending nodes, just in case there is a node somewhere inside that is set to be added if no target is found.
- The availability filter for buying new cyberware or bioware now works properly for items that do not have a fixed, forced grade.
- When browsing a list of purchaseable items, if any items are hidden by availability or cost filters, an entry will show up at the bottom of the list saying how many items are hidden. This primarily serves to remind people to check these filters if they somehow cannot find an item for which they are looking.
- In Career Mode, the dicepool quantities and tooltips for weapons mounted on vehicles are now calculated and displayed properly.
- Melee weapons mounted on vehicles no longer display a table of ranges.
- Weapon accessories on weapons mounted on vehicles now display their stat modifiers.
- Dicepools for weapons no longer display two different values when the character has a relevant specialization. Hovering over the dicepool labels will still list a specialization as the source for +2 bonus if the character does indeed have a relevant specialization.
- In the Lifestyles tab, improvements that change lifestyle costs now display the actual source of the improvement (e.g. a quality like Dependents) instead of just the type of source.
- Weapon ratings are now saved and loaded properly.
- Added an option that lets users choose the method by which mugshots are saved in save files and when exporting the sheet as an HTML or PDF file. The program can use lossless compression (PNG) or lossy compression (JPEG), with the latter also having an additional setting where the user can choose the JPEG quality at which their mugshot will be saved. Switching from lossless to lossy and/or lowering JPEG image quality can dramatically reduce the size of .chum5 save files at a loss in image quality of each mugshot (a fairly small loss at high JPEG quality).
- The program will no longer crash if an incorrectly formatted time and/or date format is entered into the Custom Time or Custom Date fields in the Options screen, respectively.
- The Description, Concept, Background, Character Notes, and Game Notes sections of characters now support rudimentary formatting.
- Selecting a Street Scum setting or the High Life setting in the Build Method screen now properly updates the shown values in the screen's numerical displays. Choosing the change the Build Method of a character with one of these settings in Create mode now also properly displays their chosen setting in the resulting Build Method screen.
- Special modifications of underbarrel weapons are now also properly processed.
- The internal GUIDs for all items that have them are now included in all print- and export-information as the "guid" field. For items that also have references to the GUID of the XML data entry off of which they are based, they will also print this information: this is the "suid" field for skills, the "metatype_guid" field for metatypes, the "metavariant_guid" field for metavariants, and the "sourceid" field for everything else.
- Negative qualities that do not give Karma but still contribute to the negative quality karma limit at character creation are now properly taken into account when new negative qualities are attempted to be added or an existing negative quality is attempted to have its level increased.
- Added a new bonus node called "selectexpertise". It lets the user select a specialization to add to their character with a +3 bonus instead of a +2. The syntax for this node is similar to that of "selectskill", but there is also the possibility for a "limittospecialization" attribute that limits the selection of specializations that can be chosen.
- Added support for Astral Reputation (from Street Grimoire) and Wild Reputation (from Forbidden Arcana). They currently still need to be adjusted manually, especially because Spirit Index is information that players are not expected to accurately have, but dicepools are adjusted accordingly, and Chain Breaker's effects are appropraitely disabled for characters who have an Astral Reputation of 3 or greater.
- Redliner's bonus is now properly updated based on the character's current cyberlimb count instead of their cyberlimb count before the given Redliner bonus refresh.
- Characters with missing or faulty source references to their metatype/metavariant now get the proper reference assigned upon their first load.
- Boxes displaying short messages and/or prompts are now centered around where Chummer's active window is instead of in the middle of the screen.
- Attempting to change a character's priorities no longer causes all metatype- and priority-given qualities and improvements to be removed and then re-added. Instead, metatype-given qualities and improvements are only removed and then re-added if the character's metatype and/or metavariant is changed, and priority-given qualities are only removed (and potentially re-added) if the character's special priority selections have changed to one that works off of a different quality.
- Native languages are now tracked separately instead of Language skills with a rating of zero being treated as Native languages.
- Advanced lifestyles no longer add an extra 50 nuyen flat monthly cost for increasing C&N, Security, and/or Neighborhood ratings.
- Chummer no longer crashes when attempting to delete the quality representing that a metatype-given quality was removed at character creation.
- The metatype selection form for Karma-based character generation options now properly remembers the character's current metatype and metavariant settings.
- The message displaying conditions that a character has not met for something that they have picked out can now properly handle condition groups.
- Condition Monitor boxes now load properly if the character being loaded has any of their boxes filled and/or have more than 24 Physical and/or Stun Condition Monitor boxes.
- Adepts with an adept power that they both have free levels/ranks in and have put PP into manually now get those PPs automatically removed from said power should the adept stop being an adept.
- Added two new XML node types to gear: isflechetteammo and flechetteweaponbonus. The former node, if its contents are set to True, indicates that the gear in question could be used by a weapon that can only fire flechette ammunition. The latter is a special version of the weaponbonus node that is only applied if the gear is loaded into a weapon that can only fire flechette ammunition, overriding the weaponbonus entry if it does so.
- Weapons that can only fire flechette ammunition can now properly only be loaded with flechette ammunition. Existing save files where these weapons are loaded with non-flechette ammunition will automatically unload said ammunition.
- Custom files for character sheets now work properly, though people who do wish to use them are recommended to add entries in every single language found in sheets.xml.
- The Cyberadept quality now properly automatically restores lost Resonance to Essence at every Submersion instead of needing a separate echo to be taken. Existing characters with these echoes will have the echoes removed upon loading their character, but their cyberadept bonus should be kept and automatically reassigned to the best applicable submersion grades.
- Fixed a regression when loading characters with suppressed qualities. Closes #4178
- Added a Master Index tab that lets users search the entire Chummer database for any entry and quickly view its sourcebook reference (and click it to open up a linked PDF). This does cause the program's initial startup time to be noticeably longer than before, so it can be disabled in the Options menu for those who do not want to use it.
- Added Group Contact Karma to the tooltip for Positive Qualities in create mode.
- Opening multiple character files simultaneously is now a lot less likely to cause the program to crash.
- Gear, Armor Mods, and Cyberware that are granted for free by something can no longer have their ratings directly altered during character creation.
- Ammo and Weapon Accessories that modify damage, AP, and/or firing modes now stack appropriately with Ammo and Weapon Accessories that replace damage, AP, and/or firing mods.
- Weapon Accessories that contain the word "Flechette" in their name no longer lower AP by 5 for weapons with an (f) damage type in a hardcoded fashion.
- Custom Fit (Stack) now works on armor types other than those in the High-Fashion Armor Clothing category. This is only relevant for custom data.
- Armor that subtracts from the character's total armor now works properly.
- Changing the ratings of Cyberlimb Customization 'ware now properly updates the character's displayed attribute values when appropriate.
- If skill points have been spent on knowledge skills, a reminder/explanation that this has happened now shows up in the Skills tab.
- The random number generator has been switched from dSFMT to Xoroshiro128**. The general statistics of the latter are slightly more secure/random than that of the former, and it also tends to run faster and with less memory.
- Items loaded in for characters originally saved under some very old versions of Chummer5a will now properly recognize the original data node of armors, armor mods, lifestyle qualities, vehicle mods, weapon accessories, critter powers, martial arts, traditions, metamagics, and magical arts.
- Weapon accessories can now modify the Reach of their parent weapon. Closes #4204
- The weapon selection form now displays weapons' base concealability.
- Vehicle and/or drone mods with a minimum rating greater than 1 now properly take their minimum into consideration for availability and cost filters in the vehicle/drone mod selection screen.
- The option to allow for skill points to be used to break skill groups no longer disables spending skill points on all skill groups under certain circumstances.
- Trying to buy gear plugin in career mode for an armor, armor mod, or gear attached in some way to an armor or armor mod without enough money now no longer leaves a "ghost" gear after the message saying that the character cannot afford the gear has been shown.
- Vehicle mods can now properly be sold in career mode.
- Changing metatypes in Create mode no longer sometimes keeps old initiative and movement speed values.
- Instead of a global option to hide charts in the Karma and Nuyen tab in Career mode, charts are hidden by default and are only shown when checking a checkbox in the Karma and Nuyen tab.
- Chummer now displays an error message if it cannot load a picture/portrait/mugshot instead of crashing.
- Changing 'ware grades during character creation now properly updates the list of available 'ware based on availability modifiers.
- Items can now be sold at 0% of their original cost instead of being limited to at least 0.01%. While normally, items that are to be deleted without reimbursement should be deleted instead of going through the selling process, this change should let people who do go through the selling process instead for some reason still be able to "sell" the item at 0%, equivalent to deleting it.
- Toggling an adept power's adept way discount should now always result in Chummer properly recognizing the change in spent PP.
- Weapons added directly to vehicle modifications can now properly be removed.
- Updated all mentions of "Sex" for a character's/contact's properties to "Gender".
- Adepts are now properly charged karma for any rituals that they learn at character generation.
- Custom date and/or time formats are now saved properly.
- Updated the link to the Chummer5a wiki to actually point to the GitHub wiki.
- The Export screen is now more informative about its (potentially quite long) loading times instead of freezing up the entire program while it loads in the exported data.
- Enemies are now handled consistently regarding Karma, and new ones can now be properly added that would make the character go temporarily over their Negative Quality Karma limits, though they will cause the character to fail their validity check if the limit stays overshot. Fixes #4235.
- Group contact Karma costs are now properly in sync with contact Karma costs should the latter be set to a higher value through Karma cost options.
- Karma expenditures for group contacts are now properly updated if/when the setting for whether a contact is a group contact is toggled in some way.
- Fixed an issue with the context menu for character tabs not being translated properly. Closes #4142
- Characters with more than the default amount of arms and/or legs should now be able to properly add multiple modular connectors associated with their extra limbs on the same side.
- Cyberlimbs now block modular connectors to the same limb that are not part of said cyberlimb.
- MAG (Adept) no longer shows up in the list of attributes for a skill if the character does not have the house rule enabled that has Mystic Adepts have two Magic attributes instead of separate Mystic Adept PPs.
- Removed vestigial code for supporting and handling Omae and Omae-managed files. The service has been offline for so long that there really isn't any use for this code anymore.
- Removed vestigial code for supporting and handling mechanics that are specific to Shadowrun 4th Edition and were not or cannot be ported to Shadowrun 5th edition.
- Improvement values and augmented values can now be decimals, not just integers. Non-integer improvements that would modify a value that must always be an integer will always get rounded up.
- The total amount of power points that an adept of some kind has can now be a non-integer.
- Unhardcoded the way Running, Swimming, and Flight require ground, swimming, and flying movement speeds in order to be enabled. Skills can now be set to require one or more of these movement speeds through the requiresgroundmovement, requiresswimmovement, and requiresflymovement nodes, and the Running, Swimming, and Flight skills have these nodes present in the base data set.
- Improvements that can alter a character's walking, running, or sprinting speeds on ground, in water, and in the air can now be added through the Improvements tab after character creation. Adding/increasing walking, running, and/or sprinting speeds in the air are a way to unlock skills that require such a movement speed to get enabled, such as Flight.
- Browsing certain pieces of armor or weapons to buy no longer fills the character's improvements list with orphaned improvements and phantom limit modifiers.
- Cancelling out of a Mentor Spirit or Paragon selection form now properly aborts the attempt to add a Mentor Spirit or Paragon.
- Added simple support for copy-pasting cyberlimbs in create mode to allow them to properly select the side. To do this, use the copy button, select the root-level cyberware node and paste it. Closes #4254
- The "Show" and "Page Break" options in the Shadowrun 5 character sheet set now work properly.
- Buying cyberware plugins in Career mode that do not affect essence when they are plugins no longer decreases the sizes of Essence holes when a character has one.
- Added in support for recognizing (some) PDF printers, and if Chummer finds any when the "Save as PDF" button is clicked, it will display a message asking if it should use the PDF printer instead of the PDF-saving system that comes with Chummer.

Data Changes:
- Removed legacy nodes for Street Scum Priority values that caused incorrect nuyen amounts.
- The custom rulesets for Toxic traditions having no requirements and for Painade being available per the German version of Cutting Aces now load and work properly.
- The custom ruleset for having the special helmets assigned to specific armors be armor mods no longer still has an armor entry for the Urban Explorer Jumpsuit's helmet.
- Adding the Sensei quality to a character no longer causes the program to crash.
- The Elementalist qualities now properly restrict the character to a specific spell category instead of limiting the character to spells with the Elemental descriptor. Because not all traditions have a spell category assigned to all four elemental spirit types, because certain traditions like Draconic don't even have any spirit types assigned to spell categories, and because custom traditions and the Paradigm Shift metamagic exist, users will need to manually select the spell category to which their character is to be restricted instead of it being determined automatically.
- The special modifications for Improved AP, Improved Reach, and Improved Recoil Comp are now properly marked as such and are therefore now taken into account when trying to add more special modifications.
- The SASS version of Inspired now properly requires an Artisan specialization to be chosen that will be added with a +3 bonus instead of applying a +3 bonus to all Artisan specializations.
- The Run Faster version of Inspired no longer incorrectly makes all Artisan specializations give a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus.
- All lifestyle assets that require the character to specify for what they are purchased for (e.g. Grid Subscription, Patron of the Arts) can now properly be purchased multiple times.
- The lifestyle assets "Merchandise: Goods (Avail X)" are now correctly named "Merchandise: Goods (Specific Item) (Avail X)" and now appropriately require the character to select the specific legal good that is being sold.
- Optical imaging scopes have been moved to a custom ruleset to abide by RAW. Optical binoculars are explicitly mentioned by RAW, but not optical imaging scopes.
- Fixed liminal centaur rear legs not being able to take digigrade leg modification. Implemented existing behaviour as a customdata entry.
- Chain Breaker now properly lets a character choose two additional spirit types that they can summon and now properly removes access to the Binding skill.
- Added content from Krime Katalog.
- All Assault Cannons now properly have a Concealability modifier of similarly-sized heavy weapons. Some of them previously had Concealability modifiers equal to Assault Rifles.
- The Telestrian Shamus' X-Ray Sensor Function can no longer be purchased separately. A custom ruleset has been added that restores the old behavior of the X-Ray Sensor Function, letting it be purchased as a regular sensor function.
- The Hammerli Gemini and other pistols with a base Concealability modifier greater than 0 now get the appropriate Chameleon Coating weapon mod available to them.
- Stick-n-Shock Flechette Rounds now properly adjust the damage types of weapons that can only fire flechette rounds.
- Added a customdata rule to allow the Ammo Skip system to use the Internal slot or the Under slot. The Under slot is still consumed preferentially, but allows weapons without the Under mount (ie revolvers) to take it.
- Evil Eye is now properly an Instantaneous spell instead of a Sustained spell.
- Fixed missing unique setting for the Muscle Augmentation bioware that caused it fail to stack with Improved Physical Attribute.
- Fixed incorrect Concealability and Spec settings for the SK/Onotari Arms Silent Claw Stiletto.
- Fixed Neocortial Neural Amplifiers not listing the correct condition modifier.
- Spirit Affinity no longer lists Watcher and Homunculus spirits among its recommendations.
- Corrected multiple instances where an item with two different entries had two different sourcebook references.
- Bolt Hole now properly starts with 4 LPs instead of 3, and now properly has a C&N maximum of 2 instead of 3.
- Not a Home now properly modifies the maximum rating of C&N instead of its value.
- SINner (Corporate Limited) now properly allows characters to define their own entry instead of picking from suggestions.
- Partial Cyberskull now properly allows nanocybernetics to be added to it.
- Fixed Ares Screech not correctly using Peak-Discharge Energy Units as ammo.
- Fixed pantherine shifter not having the Balance Recepter quality.
- Acceleration Downgrade now properly reduces the vehicle's acceleration.
- Armor Upgrade (Drone) now properly has its availability scale with its rating.
- All drone upgrades now display "Upgraded Rating" instead of "Rating" to make clear to what the item's Rating corresponds.
- Extended Clip now properly increases ammo capacity instead of adding an extra ammo slot. Existing weapons with Extended Clips attached will need to be re-added for this change to be processed.
- The Nemesis Arms Maul Stun Staff now properly recognizes the Staves specialisation for the Clubs skill.
- The Ares Citymaster, having no statted availability or nuyen costs, has had its entry removed from Chummer's base data files.
- The Mystic Aptitude adept power's page reference is now correct.
- A typo in the name of the Biocompatibility quality has been fixed (it was previously called Biocompatability).
- The range of the Ares Armatus now loads properly.
- The Dangerous Area and Obscure/Difficult to Find basic lifestyle qualities' page references are now correct.
- Ondansetron is now properly called Ondansetron instead of Ondanstron.
- The Ares Armatus is now properly recognized as a Laser Weapon.
- Peak-discharge power packs are now properly available for the Ares Redline, the Ares Lancer MP Laser, the Underbarrel Laser, and the Repeating Laser.
- The maximum number of times that Ambidextrous can be taken is now based on the number of arms the character has instead of fixed at 3. Characters who have multiple arms will still need to track for which arms they have taken Ambidextrous, as Chummer currently does not track Ambidextrous in an arm-specific fashion.
- Removed unnecessary affectbase attribute from Wendigo and Bandersnatch qualities. Closes #4232
- The AR Nails gear's page reference is now correct.
- Fixed claw bioware incorrectly adding Reach to all unarmed attacks instead of the specific weapon. Closes #4158
- Cyberlimb Optimization should now properly let a skill be selected for each iteration of the cyberware and therefore properly apply its dicepool bonus when paired up instead of it being inconsistent with both.
- The costs and availabilities of Superior Reagents and Refined Superior Reagents are now correct.

Application Changes:
- When entering Nuyen and Karma expenses for Working for the Man/People, it's now possible to flag the expense entry as always being present in the Expense log. This will in effect reduce the Career Karma or Career Nuyen by the selected amount. Closes #4096, closes #3613
- Added InitiationGroup, InitiationOrdeal and InitiationSchooling option values for Submersion and Initiation respectively. Ensures that values are correct across multiple locations. Currently not exposed to user change. 
- Traditions that have an empty Drain value will automatically be permitted to choose their drain attribute. Allows the Toxic tradition to select the Drain attributes to use.
- Added contributetobp property to Qualities as an accessible property via XML. Allows for a quality to contribute to your Limit, but not consume karma during character creation. Has no effect during career mode. 
- Exposed Note-fetching mechanism to Armor, Armor Mods, Cyberware, Gear, Lifestyle Qualities, Vehicles, Vehicle Mods, Weapons, and Weapon Accessories. When created, Chummer will attempt to fetch relevant text from the PDF, if it is linked.
- Altered behaviour of special attributes having an effective metatype minimum below zero during character creation that requires spending additional priority points. 
- Added an optional rule to preserve existing behaviour.
- Merged karma cost checks for Foci into the Focus object instead of separate Create and Career methods.
- Added support for individualising a focus based on the rules presented in Street Grimoire on page 230.
- Added support for Limit Conditions fetching their condition string from the language file instead of being baked into the object. Existing characters with these string will need to use Reapply Improvements to apply the new values. 
- Expanded functionality for the SelectText bonus type to allow providing a list of values from the XML files.
  This is provided by three node attributes:
  'xml' indicates the document to load from the data folder
  'xpath' indicates the nodes to be evaluated (Note that it's not necessary to include the final Name node
  'allowedit="True"' indicates that the user should be able to enter their own value. If not specified or 'False', the user can only choose from the filtered values.
  As an example, the SINner (Corporate) quality uses the following node: <selecttext xml="lifemodules.xml" xpath="/chummer/storybuilder/macros/mega/persistent/*" allowedit="True"/>, while the Metaposeur bioware uses <selecttext xml="metatypes.xml" xpath="/chummer/metatypes/metatype | /chummer/metatypes/metatype/metavariants/metavariant" allowedit="True" />
  It's suggested that if you want to use a custom whitelist, take advantage of the customdata system to append nodes to options.xml; completely new files may work, but are unsupported at this time.
  Duplicate values will automatically be filtered.
- Added better support for basic lifestyles and primary tenant/roommate splits bestween costs. Closes #4054
- Altered spirit control to support width flexion due to different string lengths.
- Fixed issues with vehicles not properly being allowed to select autosofts and such. Closes #3887
- Fixed regression in condition monitor boxes > 24 not showing. Closes #4074
- Right-hand panel now autoscrolls if window is below normal size. Closes #2829
- Fixed weapons not properly clearing their weapon mount when moved between character and vehicle. Closes #4108

Application Fixes:
- Fixed inability to click the Character Roster Watch Folder location. Closes #4047
- Fixed a regression in behaviour of Initiation Group prompt to spend karma when selecting the Initiation tab.
- Fixed an issue with ammo modification plugins for Weapon Mounts that caused some weapons to show 0 ammunition. Closes #4089
- Fixed focus binding karma cost improvements incorrectly being applied to all focus types. This would be exhibited by an adept with the Athlete's Way being able to purchase Qi Foci used for Improved Ability with a total discount of 8 karma instead of 2. Closes #4094
- Fixed an issue with the SelectPowers bonus that caused it to provide free power points instead of free levels for a power.
- Fixed an issue with built-in weapon mount mods not being populated for vehicles.
- Fixed a bug where canceling the creation of an advanced lifestyle would lead to orphaned improvements
- Fixed behaviour of Mystic Adepts receiving Power Point discounts from their total magic instead of the number of power points that have been paid for. 
- Fixed a regression in behaviour of weapon mount options that caused them to be included in the cost of vehicles where the weapon mount comes with the weapon. Existing vehicles with this behaviour will need to be re-purchased. 
- Fixed a regression with Custom Traditions not being properly loaded. Closes #4077
- Fixed a regression in behaviour of metagenetic qualities not loading their metagenic flag properly when using the old naming convention.
- Fixed an issue with cyberware that uses FixedValues not correctly requesting Essence value recalculation when changing the Rating.
- Fixed a crash when updating Spirit Maximum Force during create mode if the character was reduced to 0 MAG. Closes #4099

Data Changes:
- Fixed incorrect stacking behaviour for the suprathyroid gland, muscle replacement and muscle toner that caused them to fail to stack correctly. (Muscle replacement, muscle augmentation and muscle toner shouldn't stack, but suprathyroid should)
- Fixed incorrect Ammo Category on the Walther Secura Superkompakt.
- Reduced Improved Synthskin max rating to 4.
- Removed redundant selecttext bonuses from the synthlinks.
- Added 'synthstruments' from Chrome Flesh as new gear objects copied from Run Faster. 
- Added capacity to False Face cyberware.
- Stolen Gear no longer increases the character's karma, as the quality's description explicitly states that the nuyen it provides is given in the stead of the normal bonus karma. Added a customdata file that restores old behavior, as well as another file to extend this behavior to In Debt; In Debt is written very similarly to Stolen Gear, but because it is not as explicit as Stolen Gear and because HeroLab has In Debt give both karma and nuyen, its behavior was not changed.
- Fixed an issue in character sheets not correctly showing values for 'already addicted' addiction resistance pools. Closes #4082
- Added 'Reaper' variant of Slab drug from Chrome Flesh. Closes #4081
- Added the Toxic tradition.

- Resolved an issue with character sheets not properly showing programs connected to a piece of cyberware. 
- Reverted shapeshifter metatypes improperly flagging metatype qualities as shapeshifter or metahuman forms only.
- Fixed an incorrect bonus for the Mystic Guardian mentor that caused it to provide incorrect bonus types.

Build 211
Application Changes:
- Cyberlimb bonuses are now capped to 4 by default. An optional rule has been added to override this behaviour. Note that the maximum attribute value is still limited to the Total Augmented Maximum of the character's appropriate attribute, irrespective of how the limb arrives at that maximum value. 
- If a Gear object does not have a bonus node but is provided with a select value in data (ie a Camera with select='Rear-Facing'), this value will now be assigned to the Extra value. 
- Implemented bonuses for Spell Descriptors to Damage and Drain. Used by the Witness My Hate quality. The improvement type allows a comma-separated list of values; if a descriptor is wrapped in NOT (ie NOT(Area)), it will be prevented from being taken. Conversely, if a spell does not have the descriptor listed, it will not gain the bonus. 
- Spells now properly show bonuses to Damage provided by improvements.
- Added support for the base initiative dice value being higher than 1. 
- Partial refactor of the karma and priority mode choices into a single creation method to avoid duplicating code.
- Added basic support for Weapons having Ratings. Currently used exclusively by weapons created via addweapon nodes. To be added to other weapons at a later date. (Need to figure out a good way to make it work in the datagrid view)
- Added the house rule to spend skill points on broken skill groups to the options form. Closes #1990
- Black Market Pipeline no longer defaults to active if the selected object to be purchased is able to be selected with that option. 
- Restored the ability to add Gear objects to Armor Mods that have gearcapacity specified.
- Mentor spirits are now subject to the Requirements system. This allows the use of required and forbidden nodes to hide mentors that are not valid for the character.
- Added support for specifying that the value of the attribute condition is 'natural', ie excluding bonuses.
- When attempting to change the mount location of modular cyberware, an error will now be thrown if there are no viable mounts for the selected object. 
- Added support for specifying that a given piece of armour does or does not count towards a character's Encumbrance limit. While this defaults to True for all existing gear, this can be added to any new object by including an encumbrance xml node with a value of False. When applied to armour with an Override Value, ie items with Custom Fit (Stack), they will only be excluded from Encumbrance behaviour when they are expected to provide their + bonus instead. Standard +armour items like Riot Shields can also use this behaviour. See customdata\Custom Fit (Stack) Does Not Encumber\amend_encumbrance_armor.xml for an example. 
- Positive Qualities that do not count towards the quality limit are no longer doubled when using the optional rule to allow qualities to exceed the cap.
- Translator now allows translating mentor advantages and disadvantages. 
- Fixed issues with condition monitor controls greater than 24 not being shown.
- Added ammobonuspercent node to vehicle mods. This allows for weapon mount mods to modify the ammunition of their attached weapons by a percentage rather than the fixed value of the ammobonus node. 
- Added the ability to restrict weapons to only fire certain modes of bullets, ie disabling Single Shot. 

Application Fixes:
- Fixed issues witrh missing skills not being loaded properly.

- Fixed an issue with the Skills tab not showing properly when first creating a character.
- Fixed specialisations not properly being added to dicepool when firing weapons.
- Fixed a regression in the behaviour of shapeshifters in karmagen not automatically selecting 'Human' if the 'None' metavariant is selected.

- Fixed issues with copying and pasting cyberware. Note that it's currently not permissible to paste cyberware into other cyberware.
- Fixed extraneous messages about leaving a group when updating character properties if the character is a member of an initiation group.
- Fixed a regression in the behaviour of the spellcategory improvement type that caused all improvements of that type to apply to all spells.
- Fixed an issue with Talent choices not refreshing unless the metavariant index was refreshed.
- Fixed bonuses incorrectly being added twice to cyberlimbs.
- Fixed cyberware improperly being allowed to be flagged as prototype transhuman. Existing cyberware with this flag will be reverted to false.
- Unified behaviour of gear purchasing for vehicles between create and career mode. Ensures that black market pipeline is properly respected and that ammunition objects can be stacked. 
- Added catch behaviour to validate that PDF output can correctly save a file to a given path.
- Fixed issues with Fettered Sprites and Spirits not properly being able to be flagged when the Technoshaman is first purchased. 
- Fixed inanimate vessel possession not properly assigning attribute values.

- Fixed incorrect pages for prostitution and bribe gear objects.

Application Fixes:
- Fixed behaviour of the Weapon Accessory mount checks to properly work with accessories that can occupy multiple slots when one of those slots is occupied.
- Fixed a regression in the behaviour of weapon accessories to ensure they properly save and load their ammoreplace property. Existing accessories that should have this property will need to be re-added.Closes #3947
- Fixed a regression in the behaviour of the GetNode method for Characters that could cause them to fetch incorrect values from XML. Closes #3948
- Purchasing cyberware in career mode with the house rule to allow customisation of essence costs now works poperly. Closes #3941

- Added support for Geneware actually benefiting from the genetechessmultiplier improvement.  Closes #3741
- Fixed an issue with the Purchase method for cyberware that would cause Child items to always consume Essence Holes, even if being installed in parent items. Clsoes #3959
- Added a validity check for whether a character has been given two specialisations incorrectly in some cases during create mode. Mostly should only happen with house rules active.
- Refactored tooltip code for weapons to properly show sources of bonuses.
- Added a new improvement type to clamp attribute maximums (attributemaxclamp) to the metatype maximum instead of the metatype augmented maximum. This is used by the Infirm quality to prevent taking attribute bonuses that are higher than the metatype maximum.
- Altered some logic in the Weapon class to better support the Improved Ammunition Capacity accessory provided by Special Modifications.
- Fixed behaviour of cyberzombification improperly reducing metatype limits instead of increasing them. 
- Select Armor/Weapon windows now properly support translated headers on their datagrid views.

Application Changes:
- Added a new improvement type to allow qualities to become free. Used to supplant existing code that flags the Mentor Spirit as free with certain qualities.

- The Character Roster's Watch Folder now includes subfolders. 
- Added support for Priority mode using non-ABCDE arrays.
- Spells, rituals and preparations now count down from maximum, in the same way as other counters in create mode.
- Added a new improvement type that can disable a skill group selected by the user. To be used by RunnerHub customdata ruleset.

- Power Foci and Spellcasting Foci now only provide the highest of their dicepool to a given spell's dicepool per SR5 318. Implemented by https://github.com/MemeticContagion
- Critter power categories can now be whitelisted via the Improvement system. This filtering is done through a Contains operation, which means that a quality flagged as the Paranormal/Infected category matches either Paranormal OR Infected. This means that characters that should have access to the Drake, Echoes, Emergent, Free Spirit, Infected and Toxic Critter Powers categories will need to Reapply Improvements for them to be visible. Closes #3951
- Cyberware pair bonuses now allow the option to exclude themselves from the bonus by adding includeself="False" to the wirelesspairinclude node that lists which cyberwares the item pairs with. This is to prevent interaction with things like Wired Reflexes from cybersuite upgrades causing a stack. 
- The limitspellcategory improvement now supports specifying the category of spell in the bonus node.
- Added support for non-Sapient critters not being able to unlock all skills. Now, critters without this Power that do not have at least Rating 1 in the relevant skill will be prevented from taking it.
- Added new improvement types to allow selectively restricting access to spells.
  - LimitSpellCategory restricts the character to a specific Category of spells. Replaces the hardcoded Adept restriction on taking Rituals. IMPORTANT: This restriction will not take effect unless the character uses the Reapply Improvements window. 
  - AllowSpellCategory allows additional specific Category of spells to be taken. Mostly expected to be used in conjunction with limitSpellcategory for custom content. 
  - LimitSpellRange prevents taking spells that do not match a given Range.
  - AllowSpellRange allows purchasing Spells of a given Range that would otherwise be filtered by Improvements such as LimitSpell.
  - BlockSpellDescriptor prevents taking Spells that have a given Descriptor. Replaces the previous implementation of LimitSpellDescriptor.
- Added an optional rule to suppress Technomancers taking the Schooling Initiation discount, as this isn't present in any of the sourcebooks.
- Added a new improvement type, weaponspecificdice. This provides a dicepool bonus to a specific weapon, idenfiied by its internalid. Optional attribute "type" allows filtering by ranged or melee weapons. Used by weapon foci.
- Replaced selectweapon bonus on weapon foci with weaponspecificdice, as above.
- Allowed alphabetic sorting of Favorite and Recent roster lists. Note that this sorting is based on the TAG of the node, which is the full filename path.
- Added basic support for the Gunnery specialisation adding to dicepool for vehicle-mounted weapons. This is done by applying a 'gunneryspec' attribute to either the root category node, or the category node of the weapon itself. The weapon is checked first, then the category.
- Added support for the Reach improvement to apply to specifically named weapons only. This is used by adding a Name attribute to the node. 
- Added support for martial arts, techniques and maneuvers fetching notes from their books.
- Added support for metamagics being gated behind certain initiate grades, as used by the Islamic traditions from Forbidden Arcana. This is done through an improvement type, metamagiclimit. For each metamagic child node, the name of the Metamagic (or Echo) is specified in the inner text, while the 'grade' attribute limits the metamagic to being taken at that specific grade. If the grade is not specified, this acts as a whitelist for metamagics, ONLY allowing those metamagics.
- Added Dodge to the Other Info and Condition Monitor panels in Create and Career modes.
- Added basic support for right-clicking on a character tab and saving, printing or closing the file. Currently only works for the currently-selected tab.
- Added a new bonus type that sets the minimum Karma cost of increasing a Knowledge skill.  This is used by objects such as the Learning Stimulus nanoware to force the minimum to be higher than one. Closes #3229
- Added support for the various 'addspirit/sprite' improvements pulling from the critters.xml file as well as traditions.xml.
- Added a new amendoperation for the amend system: "regexreplace". This operation modifies text data by parsing the starting data with a Regular Expression pattern and then replacing the matched patterns with the text data given by the amend node.
  - When an amend node is specified with the amendoperation "regexreplace", it must also be specified with the attribute "regexpattern" whose contents must be a proper Regular Expression. If the attribute is not specified, the amend node will instead run as if it had the amend operation "replace". If the attribute is specified, but its contents are not a proper Regular Expression, the program will display an error for the faulty amend node and then continue with the rest of the amend file.
  - A "regexreplace" amend node will pattern-match and modify all instances of Chummer5a-relevant text data in the base data node (i.e. text contents, attributes) that have corresponding replacement values specified in the amend node. This means that e.g. if one only wishes to modify an attribute, they should make sure the amend node doesn't have an end tag (i.e. "<node />", not "<node></node>"), otherwise the amend node will pattern-match the base node's main text contents and modify the contents by replacing matches with an empty string (i.e. it will remove parts of the contents that match the Regular Expression pattern). If one wishes to regexreplace multiple instances of text data within a base data node (e.g. two different attributes), but have a different Regular Expression pattern for each one, they will need to do so via separate amend nodes for each pattern.
  - For more information on how Regular Expression replacing works, please consult this page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/substitutions-in-regular-expressions . The way "regexreplace" works internally is that it uses the Regex.Replace() function and takes the base data node's text contents as the input, the contents of the "regexpattern" attribute as the pattern, and the amend node's text contents as the replacement, then sets the base data node's text contents to be equal to the output from the Regex.Replace() operation.
- Added rangemodifier property to weapon accessories. This modifies the base range modifier according to the given range. 

Data Changes:

- Added disablequality improvements for vision-based qualities to the Cybereyes Basic System. 
- Fixed issues with the Dodge, Bonus Street Cred and Street Cred Multiplier custom improvements. 
- Added missing adept way discounts to the Mystic Aptitude and State of Purity powers to render them compatible with the Magician's Way.

- The Technoshaman quality/stream now properly allows the creation of a Sprite Pet. 
- Fixed typos in mentors.xml. Fixed issues with the Chaos and Holy Text not poroperly being able to take their powers for free. Closes #3955

- Added customdata for Morrissey Alta's availability. Fix provided by Keeper M.

- Fixed incorrect stats (AP mismatch, availability) on the Rolling Blades from No Future.
- Fixed an issue with the Armor Mod Helmet customdata rule not working for hardned mil-spec suits.
- Replaced existing firstlevel bonus for the Infirm quality with new attributemaxclamp improvements. 
- Added Foot Anchor weapon to the Foot Anchor cyberware.
- Added gunneryspec to most categories of weapon; most categories have been mapped as Ballistic for now, with other weapons needing to be mapped manually. Please contact the chummer dev team if you'd like to assist with this, though any pull requests will be welcomed as per normal.
- Added customdata for the above to support the SRM 1.3 ruling that the cyberweapons from SR5 benefit from Reach when used as a pair.
- Added array choices to Street Scum in gameplayoptions.xml. Added High Life gameplay option; due to lack of ruling otherwise, based off Standard Prime Runner with a different array.
- Altered the page for all Techniques that contain 'see page xx' references to referto the proper pages.
- Restricted advanced critter powers for infected from dark terrors to appropriate qualities. Need to revisist and add as qualities instead. 
- Added adrenaline filter from dark terrors.
- Added missing Shedim critter Powers from Dark Terrors.

- Added freespells custom improvement to improvements.xml
- Added knowledgeskillkarmacostmin bonus to the Jack of All Trades quality and Learning Stimulator nanoware. 
- Added missing Black Magic [alt] tradition from FA. Personal Demons bonus not implemented; will need a new bonus created for it.

- Added SR Missions 1.4 Neotokyo customdata folder. This customdata set hides qualities used in Neo-Tokyo Missions and adjusts the Availability of all Firearms according to the SRM Neo-Tokyo 1.0 document.

- Fixed incorrect  REA maximum for the Wendigo quality.

Build 209

Application Changes:
- Metagenic quality balances are now shown in the Karma summary tab while in create mode. This allows for more easily seeing how many qualities you need to take to even up, and properly accounts for the karma lost to balance up positive and negative metagenic qualities.
- Internally changed all 'Metagenetic' references (except for the improvement type) to 'Metagenic'. 
- Skills can now benefit from Conditional improvements that are not applied to the base pool of a skill. 
- Added a 'GetAvailableAmmo' int to the Print method for weapons, exposed as 'availableammo'. This provides a count of the total amount of ammunition that can fit into the current weapon.It does NOT filter by types of ammunition, just the total available amount. 
- Weapons can now use a 'useskillspec' node to force the specialisation they use in place of their name. Mostly intended to be used for Exotic Melee/Ranged weapons.
- All equipment items that specify a Rating (Cyberware, Gear, Vehicle Mods, Weapon Accessories) can now specify a RatingLabel that is applied in place of the standard Rating. For example, Fiberoptic Hair can specify that the Rating is ten-centimetre increments of length. 
- Added a hidden Built-In weapon mount that allows all weapon categories. This can be used by vehicles that come with weapon mounts that are always installed. 
- Critters can now start with cyberware and bioware.
- Added support for weapons using required and forbidden nodes. This is mostly intended to support underbarrel weapons, but can be used in the same way as other objects. 
- Critters can now be created with specialisations in skills they start with.
- Added support for armormod requirements into selectionshared. If the sameparent attribute is set to True, then the armour mod must be on the same armour parent as the new mod. Otherwise, it will just check for any mod on any full piece of armour.
- Added ICanPaste interface type that allows for checking whether the content of the Global Clipboard can be added to the currently selected item. Intent is to pull the logic out of frmCreate and into the base equipment class. 
- Moved logic for checking whether a weapon accessory is allowed into a weapon into the Weapon class. 
- All instances of the AllowGear node can now use gearname to allow limiting choices to individually named items (ie built-in medkit allows the Medkit item)
- Weapon accessories can now be copied and pasted into other weapons in create mode.
- Added support for vehicle mods coming with built-in cyberware. Supports the Caduceus drone's default snake fingers. 
- Added a global option to disable the rendering of karma/nuyen charts that cause Chummer to run out of memory in in Linux. This is intended as a temporary shim until a replacement charting tool is developed or the UI is changed.
- Added support for the selectskill improvement to prompt the user for a knowledge skill to use; if this skill is not found, it will be created, otherwise the bonus will be created for that skill.
- Added Surprise Test pool to the Other Info tab of career and create mode.
- Added an improvement type for surprise.

Application Fixes:

- The SwapSkillAtribute Improvement now properly makes the attribute get swapped for the selected attribute.
- Fixed a crash when binding Foci, if the treenode for the focus had not been selected. Closes #3905
- Anthro drones now receive 8 base physical condition monitor boxes instead of 6, per Rigger 5 rules. I don't personally agree with this rule since it effectively means they have 10 base due to limbs, but whatever. 
- addlimb improvement now supports the use of precedence nodes to allow preventing multiple sources of limbs from stacking, ie centaurs and Liminal Bodies. Closes #3550
- Fixed an issue with enemies improperly showing warnings about quality limits if they're not set to add to negative quality karma.
- Added missing DamageResistance improvement bonuses to the tooltip for Indirect Soak.
- Added support for the optionalpowers improvement being taken multiple times. This is done by adding a count attribute to the base node, which can include attributes and basic math. A spirit could have "{MAG} div 3" for example, which allows for 1 optional power for every 3 full MAG the spirit has. 
- Fixed a regression in SA-capable weapons not being able to fire Short Bursts in career mode. 
- Weapon accessories that add fire modes properly show as such.
- Fixed an issue with Armor Mods that are included in Armor improperly checking availability.

- Underbarrel weapons are now properly restricted to weapons that can take them. 
- All underbarrel weapons from Run and Gun have been properly created as weapons, where data exists for them. I'm not going to add the chainsaw, because there's no firm raw on what a chainsaw is. Closes #3553
- Added a new customdata item to override the Acceleration of the Yamaha Kaburaya from 3 to 4, per German data changes. Closes #3908
- Fixed a missing accuracy bonus for Raptor Foot cyberware when also equipped with digigrade legs. Closes #3863
- Added missing additional reagents from Forbidden Arcana. Closes #2766
- Added separately-priced SnS-Static Shaft crossbow bolts per German errata. Closes #2368

- Added correct AP value (-5) to the Riot Shield.
- Added missing Medkit and Snake Fingers cyberwares to the Shiawase Caduceus 'CAD' 7 drone.
- Added an optional rule to add the optional powers rule for sprites from Kill Code to the core book sprites. 
- Moved HTML file used by the "Print to File First" option for fixing issues with rendering sheets into appdata instead, in order to prevent issues with tools that synchronise special folders like desktop from causing the cleanup to fail.
- Added surprise bonuses for Combat Paralysis quality and Danger Sense adept power
- Adjusted duplicate GUIDs in lifemodules.xml.
- Fixed an issue with the ProCam that could cause Chummer to crash when added to a non-Gear parent. Closes #3931

Build 208

Application Changes:

- Added a genetechessmultiplier improvement type that allows for the modification of genetech essence costs in a similar manner to the biowareessmultiplier improvement.

- Weapons mounted on vehicles in create mode can now switch the dicepool calculation method they use between character skill, remote-operated gunnery and dogbrain, among others. Closes #3801

Application Fixes:

- Fixed issues with the SelectSpell improvement not being properly available in the improvements window.
- Fixed a regression in the behaviour of the cyberadeptdaemon improvement that prevented Resonance being awarded for fractional losses of Essence. In effect, this improvement was only being counted if you had an integer value of CyberwareEssence. Your Resonance will be adjusted on next Submersion, or if you activate the Reapply Improvements menu option.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to edit a basic lifestyle would cause the lifestyle level to not get properly saved.
- Changing priorities or metatypes in Create mode will no longer reset all points and karma put into attributes.
- Fixed a bug where special attributes would not update properly with changes to the Special priority category.
- Fixed a UI issue where tooltips to improve attributes or skills that are at their maximum rating would show the regular improvement tooltip with a karma cost of -1 instead of a message saying that the item is at its maximum. Closes #3664.
- Fixed an issue where the GenetechCostMultiplier improvement would not work properly. Part of #3741.
- Fixed issues where certain options in the Options screen would have their text cut off. Closes #3716.
- Fixed an issue where the screen to select a Complex Form did not pay attention to Complex Form requirements, e.g. technomancer streams. Closes #3718.
- Fixed an issue where changing Metatype priorities would not update the Special Attributes amount properly.
- Increased gear quantity limit per stack from 100000 to 1000000000 in both Create mode and in the gear selection screen. Closes #3520.

- Fixed an issue with Armor Mods that use FixedValues in Cost not correctly displaying, such as Grey Mana Integration.
- Fixed issues with improvements that add to skill ratings not properly being counted in Create mode.
- Fixed an issue where improvements that add knowledge skills that can be upgraded later still did not allow for the adding of specializations.

- Fixed an issue where upgradable knowledge skills added by improvements could get their category changed.
- Updated wkhtmltopdf (the HTML to PDF converter) to v0.12.5. Closes #3282.
- Fixed an issue where 'ware grade modifiers were not applied in the 'ware selection screen unless the 'ware grade was changed. Closes #3505.
- Fixed an issue where availabilities could be negative numbers.
- Added the ability for weapons and weapon accessories to define the number of bullets fired in Single Shots, Short Bursts, and Long Bursts.
- Added the ability for weapons to define weapon slots to which modification costs are doubled.
- Fixed an issue where weapons with an accessory cost multiplier would not have that multiplier be represented in the weapon accessory selection screen.
- Fixed a crash that occured when adding improvements for exotic skills and knowledge skills that did not have pre-made entries in skills.xml. Closes #3510.
- Added the ability for qualities to be flagged as able to be purchased in a way that would make the character go into a karma debt.
- Dates in the Karma and Nuyen tab will now always follow the format of the language in which the program is localized, rather than following the format of the language of the system in which the program is running.
- Fixed an issue where the registered sprite limit would not take augmentations into account.
- Added the ability for created Adept Power improvements to ignore power limits when selecting the affected power. Closes #3721.
- Chummy will now use translations from other languages. Closes #3540.
- Reapplying improvements after having removed a metatype removable quality will no longer cause said quality's improvements to be re-applied. Closes #3522.
- Removing the marker quality for having removed a metatype removable quality in Create mode will restore the previously removed metatype removable quality.
- Changing metatypes in Create mode will now also remove any marker qualities for removed metatype removable qualities.
- Fixed an issue that caused removing removable metatype qualities with first-level-only improvements to not remove those first-level-only improvements.
- Fixed an issue with the Karma Metatype form that would soft-lock the application waiting for an input for critter powers and programs.
- Fixed issues where crashes and unexpected behavior could occur when checking the capacity of parent gear items with children that have fractional capacity costs.
- Spells with no descriptors will no longer display a label saying that the descriptor text is not found in the spell selection screen.

- Fixed incorrect usage of SkillGroup name instead of the DisplayName. Closes #3785
- Added support for improvements that add to the dicepools of resisting direct mana combat spells, direct physical combat spells, decrease BOD, decrease AGI, decrease REA, decrease STR, decrease CHA, decrease INT, decrease LOG, and decrease WIL.
- Moved magic strings used for calculating cyberlimb attributes into explicit hashsets. This allows the 2050 cyberlimb enhancement and customisations to work properly. 
- Removed an additional cost from purchasing Gear that incorrectly caused quantity to be counted twice.
- Fixed a regression in the SpellCategory improvement that prevented it being used, as it was renamed to spellcategorydicepool.
- The Technoshaman Stream properly allows Sprites to be Fettered, granting unlimited services. Existing characters with this Stream will need to Reapply Improvements for it to work.
- Availability processing for street gear (Vehicles, Weapons, Armor, etc.) have been moved out of frmCreate and into the individual Equipment classes. Resolves issues with weapons being incorrectly flagged for availability multiple times.
- Fixed a regression in behaviour of the AttributeSection that caused Shapeshifters created prior to 5.200 to fail to load in career mode.

Data Changes:

- Fixed incorrect specialmodificationlimit property for the Special Modifications and Prototype Materials qualities. 
- Quick Healer now grants a +2 dicepool to casting the Heal spell. I strongly disagree with the wording on this personally, but it's RAW.
- Fixed missing accessories on the Lone Star Remington 995. Closes #3727.
- Fixed an issue where the Special Modification for Concealment increased concealment instead of decreasing it (i.e. it made the weapon easier to spot instead of harder to spot). Closes #3747.
- Personal Drone Rack is now a gear that can be added as a plugin to Micro-Hardpoints instead of being armor mods that take up capacity. Closes #3448.
- The Hammerli Gemini now properly doubles all Barrel accessories and modifications and uses its special firing mode of effective SA with 2 bullets fired in Single Shot and 6 bullets fired in Short Burst. It also has an ammo capacity of 16(c) instead of 8(c), though this is because it is difficult to implement the 2x clip RAW says it uses. Ammo modification costs still need to be tracked manually, as do doubled costs of Spare Clips. Existing characters with a Hammerli Gemini need to re-add the firearm to their character to see its changes.
- The Dracoform qualities can now be taken in a way that would make the character go into karma debt, and characters moving to Career mode with a Dracoform quality will have the quality's karma cost ignored for the purposes of checking whether they have enough karma left over from Create mode. Closes #3366.
- Fixed a crash that would occur when selecting a skill as an optional power. Closes #3677.
- Fixed missing Copy settings for some custom data entries that prevented them being copied into release folders. 
- Added a customdata rule for the German variant prices for Rigger 5's drone turrets. Closes #3760
- Added the Convince spell to German-exclusive Street Grimoire content, as the German edition of Street Grimoire contains it. Closes #3707.
- Added various missing critters from sourcebooks and updated partially-incorrect mentor spirits from SOTA 2080, courtesy of Keeper M on Discord. 
- Adjusted the Chaos mentor spirit to allow taking two levels of Improved Potential. This is done through adding a separate power that prompts for the limit to choose.
- Replaced all instances of weapons that could choose between a box magazine (c)and belt-fed (b), External/Internal Source or drum (d) with the (c) ammo by default. There are now zero-cost accessories that enable the alternates for these weapons.

- Fixed incorrect Availability on the Federated Boeing Commuter. Closes #3833

Build 206

New Features:

- Added a 'helpful' digital assistant, Chummy! Chummy is designed to offer tips via tooltip based on your character's content. It's designed for expansion through tips.xml, using the same forbidden/required structure as qualities. Yes, it's an April Fool's gag. I'm sorry, I thought it was cute and/or amusing. It can be toggled off by deselecting the Allow Easter Eggs option in the Global Options menu. 
- Created a new Improvement Type that improves the dicepool of a specific spell; the spelldicepool improvement is available in the Custom Improvement creator. 
- Implemented the Special Modifications and Prototype Materials qualities from Better Than Bad. The assorted bonuses are added through the Select Weapon Accessories form, allowing for custom content to be created. Note for content creators, the specialmodificationlimit property is used to indicate how many 'points' of the quality are consumed; this isn't super close to rules as written, but it's viable for our purposes. 
- Exposed ParentDetails requirement checks to Armor Mods. This allows for filtering mods based on the XML properties of their parent, such as filtering based on name or armour value.
- Gameplay Options can now be used as a forbidden/required choice for items; currently this is used for the Free Insect Spirit qualities, which require the Prime Runner gameplay choice. 
- Cyberware now supports the use of math operators in the ess and cost values. This allows for customdata files to easily make bulk changes to cyberware Essence and Cost entries.
- Reimplemented the addsprite and addspirit improvement types to support adding Watchers, Homunculi and other spirit types that are added separately to a tradition.
- Created new Improvement Types to support the Networker and Massive Network qualities from No Future.
  - The ContactKarma improvement type changes the cost for all contacts by the listed amount.
  - The ContactKarmaMinimum improvement type changes the minimum cost for contacts. The minimum is assumed to be 2.

Application Fixes:

- Slightly better implementation of the Upgrade mechanism for cyberware. Still needs work, but shouldn't improperly consume Essence anymore. 
- Fixed an issue with cyberware that should not permit subsystems still doing so. 
- Fixed incorrect consumption of capacity by modular limbs connecting to modular connectors. 
- Fixed the behaviour of the Death Mentor Spirit's Magician benefit to allow dicepool benefits for specific skills. Uses the spelldicepool improvement.
- Fixed an issue with traditions not probably updating.
- Fixed issues with use of Essence Antiholes in create mode that prevented them from working reliably.
- Fixed an issue with the selectatributes improvement that caused it to improperly allow Exceptional Attribute to select Edge.
- Fixed issues with Dedicated Spellslinger not working properly in career mode.
- Fixed a crash when opening the Print Multiple Characters dialog multiple times.
- Fixed incorrect metatype minimums for metasapients when using priority generation.
- Fixed missing matrix condition monitors for equipment.
- Fixed a parsing issue with the check for if multiple attributes could be at metatype max that could occasionally cause a clash.
- Fixed issues with the implementation of the dual attribute connection for shapeshifters that caused them to inconsistently use the correct attribute.
- Fixed an issue with the adding of One Trick Pony's free technique.
- Fixed behaviour of the selectweapon improvement that caused it to freeze if the ForcedItem quality were specified but the list of weapons did not contain the forced item.
- Fixed an issue with adding gear to weapon accessories when the weapon accessory was installed with the weapon.
- Fixed behaviour of Armor Mods improperly not showing their modification of parent items.
- Added logic to prevent accepting a custom drug that does not have a Foundation or a Name without adding the drug successfully.
- Fixed behaviour of deletion of custom drug recipes in create mode.
- Unified behaviour of Essence improvements between cyberware and bioware.
- If no spirit limit is specified for the limitspiritcategory improvement, the improvement will now prompt for all known spirit types.

Application Changes:

- Spells now properly store their Source ID. Used for some Improvements. 
- Small refactor to the Spell class to use RelevantImprovements method. Doesn't actually reduce complexity, but makes me feel a bit better about having less boilerplate. 
- Added a string to the Skill.Core class that allows for formatting the skill's dicepool, specialisations and such instead of reprocessing it in multiple other locations.
- Refactored the creation, saving and loading of GUIDs for the Internal ID and Source ID of all objects to provide more consistency. There is a small risk that this will impact the stored improvements of some characters. I haven't been able to prove that it will happen, but logically it should based on this change. 
- Removed the caching of Mugshot images in the character roster. Prevents high memory usage for large watch folder content.
- Unified some uses of Availability processing into the AvailabilityValue object.
- Crash reporter now prevents uploading issues unless the user story in the Error Description tab has been changed.
- Added a conditional check in the requirements validator that checks for the spirit form of a given tradition. Expected values are Materialization, Possession or Inhabitation. 

UI Changes:

Build 205

Application Changes:
- Added a new improvement type - actiondicepool - to support specific Actions receiving dicepool bonuses. Currently only Threading is supported by this.
- Fixed behaviour of Exotic weapons to prevent them from from using the first exotic skill found.
- Exposed the selection of AI programs to the main RequirementsMet method. Prevents issues with programs not being translated, offends me slightly less. Fixes #3350
- Fixed processing of FixedValues on the Select Gear window.
- Refactored string processing method for Gear Ratings into a single method. Allows MinRating, MaxRating, MatrixAttributes and TotalBonusMatrixBoxes (for LivingPersona only) to use complex strings such as {Parent DeviceRating}. Fixes #3360
- Foxed some behaviour in creation of packs to properly allow creatio nof lifestyles.
- Fixed behaviour of child Cyberware with the AddToParentESS flag not properly adding their essence cost to the parent.

- Altered the Mentor Spirit selection window to hide list choices that can't be taken due to Magician or Adept requirements.
- Better check for open files when trying to restart the application after updating.
- Orphaned improvement checks are now made on every character load. This is still a hackish method to get around the issue with Qi Foci that affect Improved Ability (Skill) causing orphaned improvements, but it's generally a healthy attitude to take anyway. In order to prevent character corruption without user acceptance, it will also prompt if you want to abort loading the character until you've taken a backup.
- Made additions to the nuyenamt improvement to allow specifying specific conditions for which the nuyen is used. This in turn supports the Stolen quality of Equipment objects, allowing the Stolen nuyen to be spent exclusively on these items without affecting the overall nuyen budget of the character.

- Added a Save As Created option to the File window of characters in Create mode; this does not require that the Mark as Created checkbox be checked on the Character Info tab.

- Minor change in functionalty of the UnarmedImprovementsApplyToWeapons improvement type that now permits UnarmedReach improvements to affect weapons that use the Unarmed Combat skill. 
- Improved functionality of gameplayoptions to decouple the link between a character's starting karma and their quality limit. Closes #3436

- Fixed an issue with inability to add user-enterable specialisations in active or knowledge skills.

- Allowed the Peak-Discharge energy packs to be added as accessories to weapons with External Source ammo types. Fixes #3361.
- Fixed incorrect specialisation requirement for the Death Dealer quality.

- Fixed a crash when adding the Rockblood Signature Armored Shirt.
- Fixed incorrect cost for the Fuchi Cyber-N.
- Gameplayoptions entries can now specify qualitylimit; this sets the maximum amount of positive and negative karma that can be spent on qualities. If not specified, it will revert to using the karma value. 
- Fixed incorrect Ammo strings on the Walther Secura Superkompakt, HK Urban Striker and HK DMR 11D.
- Fixed incorrect AP value on the Trollbow's melee option. 
- Altered the Regeneration critter power to permit Deltaware bioware.
- Altered the Hand Razors and Hand Blade cyberwares to be limited by the number of arms a character has and be limited to being installed into things with fingers. Included a customdata file to remove this requirement.
- Changed incorrect CHA defaults for the Xenosapient AI metavariant.
- Fixed incorrect range and concealability on the Morrissey Elite. 

New Strings:
- Message_OrphanedImprovements
- MessageTitle_OrphanedImprovements

- Added gear as a requirement check.

- Fixed an issue with MAG being removed incorrectly when using the Mystic Adept Second Attribute optional rule if the charactrer started with a magic attribute, such as shapeshifters. Fixes #3253
- Fixed behaviour of plugins incorrectly applying their Essence costs in career mode instead of using the capacity cost. Should fix #3279, may have some additional edge cases.

- Fixed an issue where removing Metatype Removable qualities at character creation would not sometimes not end up altering the quality list and/or character karma properly. Fixes #2876.
- Fixed an issue where completely deleting certain qualities with levels attached to them would only remove the improvements originating from the first level until the character was loaded from a save file (at which point the orphaned improvements would have gotten culled). Fixes #2972.

- Cyberware and bioware can now be flagged to increase the capacity cost of its parent 'ware instead of attempting to occupy capacity.

- Reorganized the options menu so that global options that are independent from the currently opened character are easier to tell apart, and so that the PDF information of individual sourcebooks can be modified even if a custom ruleset is enabled that disables the given sourcebooks.
- The options menu now supports selecting a default gameplay option when creating a new character instead of modifying the default max availability and max starting karma amounts.
- Gameplay options can now declare default values for karma levels under Point Buy, karma levels under Life Modules, and Sum-to-X value under Sum-to-Ten build methods in their XML entries.

Fixes #3117.
- Fixed an issue where items that came built into items originating from different sourcebooks (e.g. a lifestyle quality from Run Faster coming by default with a lifestyle from the Core Rulebook) would process necessary sourcebooks for the character incorrectly. Existing saved characters with this issue will still have it, but no newly saved characters going forward will have this issue. Fixes #3109.
- Fixed a bug where characters without Run Faster enabled could still add Advanced Lifestyles despite them being part of Run Faster.
- Fixed an issue where limit modifiers added by improvements could get edited and/or deleted independent from their improvement.
- Fixed an issue where some limit modifiers added by gear would not get properly removed when the gear was removed. Technical fix for #3115, though existing characters with these issues will need their existing, orphaned limit modifiers removed manually.
- Added a limited-functionality Hero Lab importer tool. This tool can convert .por files into Chummer5a characters to a certain extent, as certain character elements aren't saved in ways that can be (easily) converted into Chummer5a information.
- Fixed an issue where weapon accessories often would not get their proper ratings set. Fixes #3123.
- Fixed an issue where renaming various locations would not cause the corresponding node in the appropriate TreeView to update. Fixes #3078.

- Fixed an issue where Magic-enabled characters without access to the Spells & Spirits tab could not be exported into Career mode because the program would prompt them for a Tradition that they are unable to select without access to the Spells & Spirits tab. Fixes #3148.
- Fixed an issue where opening multiple characters from the command line would cause the program to open multiple instances of the last character in the list. Fixes #3151.
- Fixed an issue where Essence Antihole would get treated like regular Cyberware instead of the opposite of an Essence Hole, e.g. in having Biocompatibility reduce the Essence effect of an Essence Antihole. Fixes #3146.

- Fixed an issue where skillsofts could grant ratings higher than the user's skilljack rating.
- Unhardcoded checks for skillsofts and activesofts. These bonuses can now be granted by any item, not just gear in the Skillsofts category.

- Fixed the No Armor Encumbrance house rule from applying by default and not being changable through the UI.
- Added the ability to use groups in forbidden and required sections where the user is only required to have one of the items in the group (intended for use within "allof" nodes). These groups are processed via "grouponeof" nodes.

- Fixed a crash that occurred when entering the "Karma and Nuyen" tab with a karma or nuyen entry whose date is set to sometime after the current date and time of the user, as well as when adding a karma or nuyen entry with a date set to sometime after the current date and time of the user.

- Fixed an issue where increasing the quantity of gear in career mode would increase gear costs by the total cost of the current stack and then multiply costs by the current stack's quantity, instead of just increasing costs by the cost of the current stack's children and multiplying costs by the current stack's parent's quantity. Fixes #2527.
- Fixed an issue where two gear items with children of differing quantities could still be treated as if they were identical pieces of gear.
- If the updater fails to connect, it will now display the actual error that caused it to fail to connect.

- Fixed an issue where a spell's Limited and/or Extended status would not be properly reflected in the tooltip of its drain value.

- Fixed an issue where changes to special attribute loss amounts in career mode would cause any and all karma levels associated with that special attribute to get burned away every time the character is updated until all karma levels have been burned for them.
- Fixed an issue where canceling out of an "Add & More" prompt and then accepting a form through a method other than "Add & More" would still cause the form to think the user accepted the form via "Add & More".

- Implemented a number spinner for Mystic Adept Power Point costs.
- Implemented a DisplayAccuracy property for weapons, to be used by forms.
- Implemented a Location field to allow mapping weapon mounts to specific locations on a vehicle.

- Unhardcoded the weapon skill accuracy increase given by the Enhanced Accuracy power so that it can now be used through weaponskillaccuracy bonus nodes.
- Fixed an issue where bonus accuracy from Laser Sight (2050) would stack with smartgun accessories.

- Completed the implementation of Dedicated Spellslinger providing discounts with specialisations.
- Fixed an issue where launching Chummer5a under Mono (in Linux) would cause the program to crash on certain builds.

- Fixed some crashes related to multi-threaded code and logging.
- Fixed an issue with shapeshifters not getting their qualities and powers properly.
- Fixed an issue where Custom Item names would not properly display in non-English languages or get translated between languages should their names be translatable.
- When adding a new Limit Modifier, the Limit Modifier type is determined by a ComboBox selection in the Limit Modifier selection screen, rather than based on the currently selected Limit Modifier type node.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Limit Modifiers from being edited properly.
- The limit to which a Limit Modifier applies can now be changed when editing a Limit Modifier.
- Limit modifiers from improvements are now properly tracked and removed if the source of the limit modifier is removed. Removed redundant treenodes from the Limits tab.

- Fixed an issue with armour bundles causing a crash when attempting to move items in or out of them.
- Fixed an issue where if a character's condition monitor threshold offset was greater than or equal to the regular number of condition monitor boxes they need filled per wound penalty, they would get "positive" wound modifiers applied (i.e. a dicepool bonus).
- Fixed an issue where various UI elements in the advanced lifestyle selection screen would not get translated.
- Added support for vehicle mods to get their Extra strings determined by any "select"-type bonus node, not just selecttext.
- Added the ability to target items containing the "'" character (single apostrophe) in the xpathfilter attribute of the amend system. To do so, use the "&quot;" string where you'd want to insert a quotation mark as the delimiter in the XPath filter, which should free up the "'" character (single apostrophe) to be able to be used inside the delimiter without generating errors.
- Live Custom Data now properly supports "override" and "amend" files in addition to "custom" files. Keep in mind that processing "amend" files can be especially time-consuming, so do please try to avoid using too many of them as live custom data if possible unless you're OK with Chummer5a becoming especially unresponsive.
- Added support for bonuses that query the user to select a tradition.
- When selecting a cyberware or bioware plugin, Essence cost is now only displayed as non-zero if the currently selected item would add to its parent's essence cost.
- Fixed an issue that prevented custom metatypes from being properly selectable despite being visible in the appropriate form.
- Fixed behaviour that prevented knowledge skills with names that match default skills from having their Type changed.
- Fixed an issue with reapplying improvements replacing Adapsin grades with standard ones.

- Fixed an issue where having more than 100 months' equivalent of a lifestyle paid would not correctly flag the lifestyle as being permanently purchased.
- Added the ability for any lifestyle to support bonus LP, not just Traveler, and if the user is editing a lifestyle that supports bonus LP, they can opt to manually edit the value or set it to a random 1D6 value.
- Fixed an issue where the "Quality Contributes to LP" checkbox did not function properly in the advanced lifestyle selection window.
- Shifted around some labels in the advanced lifestyle selection window so that they make more intuitive sense.
- Decrementing months/weeks/days from a lifestyle now generates an expense log entry to help keep track of things.
- Editing a lifestyle in career mode now deducts from the character's nuyen if the lifestyle after changes has a greater total cost than before (e.g. it has 1 month paid and the user adds a quality to the lifestyle that has a nuyen cost). An expense log entry is now also generated after editing a lifestyle, regardless of whether nuyen is deducted or not.
- Fixed an issue where recoil compensation from strength was displayed incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug where drain attributes could be selected for a custom tradition of a physical adept (who would always drain with BOD + WIL regardless). This also fixes an associated bug where attempting to select drain attributes for a custom tradition on a physical adept would cause Chummer5a to freeze up and behave weirdly.
- Fixed an issue where the option to calculate contact points based off of total CHA value would sometimes not work.
- Fixed issues where the tooltips and/or displayed values for Street Cred, Notoriety, and Public Awareness were sometimes incorrect or missing factors that contributed to the particular value.

- Fixed an issue where magic users who were neither adepts nor had any magician abilities could not select a tradition.
- The Initiation tab now defaults to being enabled if the user has either magic or resonance enabled, and now works through the disabletab bonus as an opt-out instead of the enabletab bonus as an opt-in.
- Fixed an issue where switching from a mystic adept to a physical adept when the character had spells and/or rituals that could still be used by a physical adept would still cause the character to lose access to those spells.
- Unhardcoded the Born Rich bonus.
- Corrected Advanced Lifestyle cost calculation for increased Comforts, Area and Security values. Fixes #2625
- Made the Garage Lifestyle qualities available multiple times per Lifestyle
- Moved the logic for toggling Prototype Transhuman-affected bioware from Character into the Improvement system. Resolves an issue with Reapply Improvements permanently disabling the Cyberware's bonus. Existing characters that have been affected by this behaviour will need to amend it manually. 

Data Changes:

- Fixed an issue where the group contact associated with Made Man would still cost karma as a group contact. Fixed an issue where removing Made Man would not undo the forced increase in loyalty it has on the associated group contact. Fixes #2492.
- Fixed an incorrect penalty for the Addiction (Burnout) quality.
- Initiation/Submersion Grades can now print their notes in thge option to do so is enabled, and any Arts, Enhancements or Metamagics/Echoes are included as child nodes. Sheets will still need to be adjusted to accommodate this.

- Cyberdecks and cyberterminals from Shadowrun 2050 now have their Matrix attributes populated where possible. "MPCP" is translated as Device Rating, "Härte" is translated as Firewall, "Aktiver Speicher" is translated as program slots, and "I/O" is translated as Data Processing. Memory storage space ("Speicherbänke") will still need be to tracked manually.
- Fixed a crash that would occur when adding the Infected: Fomoriag quality due to a misnamed critter power.
- Fixed bonus power ranks not applying properly to the Chaos, Artist, Holy Text, and Death mentor spirits. 
- Fixed Holy Text not providing a knowledge skill bonus.
- Fixed incorrect availabilities for activesofts, knowsofts, and linguasofts that were using core rulebook values instead of Chrome Flesh values.
- Fixed incorrect Essence cost for skillwires, which was using the core rulebook value of 0.1 x Rating instead of the Chrome Flesh value of 0.2 x Rating.

- Fixed an issue where adepts following The Spiritual Way could not learn Psychometry, but could learn Sympathetic Linking without Psychometry.

- Fixed an issue where Damage Compensators (2050) would use a regular threshold offset that applies separately to Physical and Stun condition monitors instead of one shared between them.

- Corrected a typo in the name of "Orichalcum" (it was originally called "Orichalum").
- Fixed Hedge Witch/Wizard increasing drain by 2 instead of decreasing drain by 2.

- Fixed the data for drones to properly use weapon mounts instead of mods.
- Added an amend entry for the Federated-Boeing PBY-70 Catalina II, which has additional weapon mounts in the German version of Rigger 5. Fixes #2555

- Fixed a bug where Alchemical Focus formulae and Disenchanting Focus formulae would apply bonuses that would normally require a focus to be bound.
- Various magical supplies, formulae, foci, and reagents that previously did not query a text selection now require the user the select a tradition to which they are linked. This helps keep track of mismatched tradition penalties.
- Added amend entries to provide replacement Garage qualities. tl;dr version for why is that this allows for language files to update the new name without forcing a rename of the base quality in the language file.
- Fixed a typo in the "Contributes to Lifestyle Points" label.

- Fixed an issue where the possession method selection box could never be enabled when creating a new critter.

- Fixed an issue where karma expenditures on martial arts at chargen would not get displayed in the sidebar.

- Fixed an issue where the house rule for attribute points getting spent after karma did nothing. Note that it will not affect attribute values when spending on special attributes with values lost from Essence loss (i.e. special attribute points will still be spent before Essence loss modifiers are applied, and karma will still be spent after Essence loss modifiers are applied), though it will still affect karma costs associated with them. Fixes #2472.

- Altering custom data directory information in the options menu will now immediately apply those changes instead of requiring Chummer5a to restart (though the prompt will still appear just in case).
- Adjusted the NewSpellKarmaCost improvement to support restrictions based on spell type.
- If a custom XPath filter is specified in an amend node, the amend node will now only use that XPath filter to find its target(s) instead of using it in addition to any specified id or name node contents.
- Fixed an issue where skill group names would get cut off if they are too long.
- Added the ability for talent priority entries to specify the possibly pool of skills or skillgroups to choose from with an xpath filter.
- Fixed an issue where modifying the load order of a custom data directory after modifying whether it is enabled or not would reset any changes made to whether it was enabled or not.
- Fixed issues with copying and pasting weapons to and from vehicle mounts, gear to and from armor mods, and gear children to and from gear parents.
- Fixed an issue where Complex Form information was not properly translated.

- Added an improvement that adjusts the fading value of complex forms.
- Fixed a bug where armor locations could not be rearranged via drag-and-drop.
- Fixed an issue where skills attached to critters would not get their names translated when printing to character sheets. Fixes #2488.

Data Changes:

- Added new items to allow for translation of certain extras, special equipment, and non-standard form factors that come with certain vehicles, weapons, and gear. Fixes #2309.
- Dodge General Trailer now properly contains an Aeronautics Mechanic Workshop (it's "Aircraft Repair" in the sourcebook, but this would not line up with the skill associated with repairing aircraft for which said workshop would be used).
- Basic Razorboi and Advanced Razorboi Packs now properly come with Cybertechnology Toolkits (it's "Cybernetics" in the sourceboo, but this would not line up with the skill associated with cybernetics for which said toolkit would be used).
- Removed the ".RF" identifier from the name of Run Faster's College Education and Inspired qualities. Removed the "(SASS)" identifier from the name of Sail Away Sweet Sister's Great Mother mentor spirit. Data that targets these items will need to rely on their id nodes.

- Removed extra base Recoil Compensation from the HK G12A4 from SAG.
- Fixed a bug where the Evo Atlantis was granting two cyberfins instead of cyberfins on both hands and both feet.

- Fixed incorrect available mod slots for most of the drones from Rigger 5.

- All shifters have had their Uneducated quality updated to be removable with Karma.
- Dedicated Spellslinger quality now only discounts Spells, excluding Enchantments, Rituals and Preparations.

Build 197

Application Changes:

- Fixed issues with certain selection forms not obeying restriction requirements if the search field is not empty.
- Switched the spell selection form to a style similar to most other selection forms, i.e. categories are selectable in a dropdown box and spells are located in a list view, instead of using funky tree views.
- Users can now use the Search function in the spell selection screen even if spell categories are limited to a single category.
- PACKS kits will no longer display or add items that require sourcebooks that are not enabled for the character.
- Chummer5 will no longer do spooky things if it cannot find an item tied to a particular forced value for a selection screen.
- Lifestyle dropdown boxes will now only be populated by items that abide by the character's enabled sourcebook list (so e.g. Commercial lifestyle will not show up if Run Faster is not enabled).
- When selecting critter powers for someone who can have optional critter powers, the displayed powers will now properly be filtered by the category selected in the category dropdown box.
- Fixed a crash that occured when an expense was undone or when a character file got an update outside of Chummer and the "live updates from character file" option was enabled.
- Fixed a crash when adding PACKS kits containing vehicles. Fixes #2155.
- Fixed an issue with the Notes sheet not loading under fr-FR localization.
- Fixed a bug where knowledge skill specializations bought with points under Point Buy or Life Modules would still deduct karma from the character.
- Fixed a bug where skill pool tooltips and other texts that fetch the names of bonus sources would not fetch the name of Mentor Spirits.
- Fixed a crash when attempting to fire Vehicle Weapons.
- Fixed calculation of armour to properly account for armour with override values (ie High Fashion Armour Clothing).
- Fixed a crash when attempting to add a specialization to a custom knowledge skill in career mode. Fixes #2156.
- Fixed standard weapon mounts accidentally adding their costs to their parent's total cost. 
- Added Free and Markup checkboxes to the weapon mount creator for use in Career mode.
- Completely merged the Commlink and Gear classes. Matrix stats now function independently of whether or not a gear can form a persona, and only gears that can form personas will now show up in commlink sections. This should also fix Persona Firmware not being required to allow a gear to be marked as an active commlink. Fixes #2158.
- Gear no longer adds its children's Matrix attributes to its own. Instead, separate stats are kept track of for Matrix attribute modifiers.
- Quantities of gear entries that begin with "Nuyen" will now follow the decimal formatting of nuyen cost formatting. Fixes #2157.
- The updater's install code will now attempt to handle files that are currently in use and then abort with a warning if it does not succeed instead of crashing. Fixes #2165.
- Fixed an issue with reapplying improvements for Mentor Spirits who have an "all" bonus where choices are required. Fixes #2153.
- Implemented an improvement to the selectquality method that allows having another quality provide a discount, which is used by the Wildcard Chimera quality.
- Fixed the implementation of the selectskill improvement to properly support Exotic skills. Characters with improvements such as Improved Ability (skill) should Reapply Improvements or remove and re-add the improvement source.
- Matrix Attributes are now an interface that is connected to Gear, Vehicle, and Cyberware and are able to fully interact with one another. Among other things, this means that Matrix Attributes will always show up for those items, that Electronic Modifications for Cyberware and Vehicles are possible, and that Cyberware with the Persona Firmware Electronic Modification will show up as a Commlink (and if the appropriate checkboxes are available in the UI, can be marked as an AI home node and/or the user's active commlink).
- Limit Modifier sources will now automatically display translated names when switching languages.
- Improvement source names will now also contain information about the source's parents. Fixes #2082.
- Fixed characters with Friends in High Places not being able to pass character validity checks for their Friends in High Places contacts. Fixes #2171.
- An AI can no longer adopt an item as a home node if it would not have enough program slots to hold it.
- Vehicles and cyberware can now have custom-defined Matrix attributes and/or Matrix attribute arrays in their data files.
- Added Notes fields to all Create methods for objects.
- The Translator tool can now be opened from within Chummer via Tools > Translator.
- Added a "Rebuild" button to the Translator tool. When used, it will regenerate the strings of an existing translation, removing any unused strings and adding any new ones that have been added after the document was initially created.
- Fixed a crash when refunding vehicle purchases in career mode. Fixes #2184.
- Fixed weapons on weapon mounts not being calculated into sell and refund amounts.
- Fixed behaviour of ArmorRating property to properly account for the Custom Fit (Stack) rules from Run and Gun again.
- Fixed a bug where the quality level numerical up-down would never be enabled in Career mode.
- Fixed a bug where Re-Apply Improvements would not properly re-apply bonuses of 'ware, first level bonuses of qualities, and bonuses tied to items that were included in a filter list but whose parents were not included.
- If the updater encounters an error during installation of the new update, it will now restore the old versions of all files. Fixes #2175.
- Added support for translation of items in ranges.xml and spiritpowers.xml. Updated the translator to also process data from these files.
- Fixed various issues regarding encumbrance, Custom Fit, clothing, and items that add armor value. Fixes #2188.
- Made some minor tweaks to lifestyles. Fixes a quirk if a character gains Improvements that change their lifestyle costs, cost alterations from lifestyle qualities are shown in their treenode. 
- Fixed incorrect Concealment values for Bio-Spike II and III.
- Multiple languages can be translated at the same time using Translator, and it now supports cancellation of Create and Rebuild operations.
- Altered the format of entries in ranges.xml so that they conform to a similar format as other data types (their names are now stored in "name" nodes instead of "category" nodes). This also fixes issues with the Translator incorrectly loading and saving range entries.
- The amend system for custom data now supports the use of custom XPath filters. This means that a single amending node can now modify multiple nodes based on whatever XPath filters are defined in its xpathfilter attribute. The "Cyberlimbs Cannot Add Headware" custom ruleset in the customdata folder has been updated to use this system, and it now also serves as an example for how to use custom XPath filters for amends.
- Tabs can now be scrolled through with the mousewheel.
- Ghetto workaround to allow exotic ranged weapons to buy their own ammunition again in career mode. Super fragile, may break at the drop of a hat.
- Added "Active Commlink" and "Home Node" checkboxes to the Cyberware tab, and added an "Active Commlink" checkbox to the Vehicles tab.
- Fixed a bug where player names would not show up in the character roster. Fixes #2195.
- Weapons on vehicles/drones that use STR, Physical Limit, and/or AGI for their stats will now properly use attributes based on that vehicle/drone.
- Fixed issues regarding undoing expenses involving weapon mounts, armor, and/or armor mods.
- Fixed issues with refunding lifestyle expenses if a character has two or more lifestyles of the same type/level.
- Added support to use attributes and XPath expressions in a weapon's AP field.
- Added a label in Create mode that becomes visible when a character has Prototype Transhuman. This label tracks the current amount of essence used up by 'ware marked as Prototype Transhuman. Fixes #1764.
- Fixed being able to mark 'ware children as Prototype Transhuman independently from the main 'ware itself.
- Fixed being able to mark Cyberware as Prototype Transhuman.
- Fixed Essence usage displays in the 'ware tab not properly reflecting the setting for Essence decimals to which to round.
- Fixed a bug where player names would not show up in the character roster.
- Cyberware, Gear, Armor and Armor Mod Ratings are now properly bound by their Min and Max Ratings. May cause issues in career mode if you suddenly become Aged with cyberware or something, but eh. Baby steps.
- Fixed a crash when adding multiple armor mods a given piece of armor in career mode.
- Fixed a potential crash when loading lifestyles that didn't have their base lifestyle saved properly.
- Added preliminary support for being able to switch languages without restarting Chummer. This also feeds into character sheets that would be printed in a language different from the one under which Chummer is running. Note that not all strings properly update yet.
- Added a basic system for management of vehicle-based firing modes. 
- Implemented support for vehicle mods altering the ammo capacity of a given weapon mount's weapon(s). 
- Added support for editing weapon mounts in create mode, career mode edits will come when I sort out how to manage the Expenses properly. 
- Fixed behaviour of the selectpowers improvement not working properly for powers that depend on having a Rating.
- Various build methods can now ban specific grades of 'ware instead of relying on a blanket ban of Betaware, Deltaware and Gammaware at character creation. Custom and override gameplayoptions.xml files will need to be updated manually to accommodate this change.
- Banned grades are now not shown while in create mode. Optional rules to override this behaviour if the character has Restricted Gear or under other specific circumstances will come in a later build as part of #1089.
- Fixed a bug where selected category and selected grade were not saved in the cyberware and bioware selection screens.
- Fixed a bug where the Translator tool was saving page numbers in an incorrectly named node. Existing translations will automatically get their page number nodes renamed if they are rebuilt.
- Fixed an issue with the Translator tool incorrectly saving gameplay options as part of the entries for the priorities file.
- Fixed alternate page references never showing up for translated skills.
- Fixed a bug where the Translator tool would not properly consider and treat alternate codes for books.
- Added a small shim to the skill loader that prevents an error if the character somehow gains two copies of the same skill.
- Removed the nomission property, as this is now managed by customdata.
- Fixed a bug where the optional rule for having positive quality costs double if over the limit would not get enabled/disabled properly.
- Added the ability to have echoes as part of "forbidden" and "required" nodes.
- Removed a readonly flag that prevented using the selectparagon bonus.
- Fixed the selectspell improvement to properly add the relevant spell to the character. 
- Tweaked the list of Spells to be an observable collection to allow updating the UI whenever the spell list changes.
- Added support to the Amend system to be able to use operations other than the default ones. The four currently supported operations are "recurse" (perform amending recursively on children), "replace" (completely replace the target node's InnerXml), "append" (add to the target node's InnerXml), and "remove" (remove the target node). If no operation is specified, "recurse" is the default if the target node(s) have children and "replace" is the default if they do not. The 'remove="yes"' system for marking nodes for removal has been replaced by 'amendoperation="remove"'.
- Fixed a bug where strings related to contacts were not properly translated.
- Fixed a bug where certain changes to maximum MAG and/or maximum RES would not properly change the maximum Force/Level values for spirits and sprites tied to the character.
- Fixed a bug where canceling out of the karma spending prompt to fetter a spirit would still cause the spirit to be fettered.
- Fixed translation system for certain strings in the Relationships tab, metatypes in the character roster, labels in the weapon mount creation screen, and other, miscellaneous strings. Fixes #2238.
- Fixed issues with printing nested gear and nested cyberware in the Shadowrun 5 character sheet set.
- Fixed an issue with the Vehicles character sheet set trying to fetch "Parachuting" instead of "Free-Fall" for skills relevant to aerial vehicles.
- Updated the livingpersona improvement so that it uses SR5e values instead of SR4e ones. Fixes #2239.
- Added improvements for adding complex forms through bonus nodes via selectcomplexform and addcomplexform, which function almost identically to their spell counterparts. Fixes #2242.
- Added a checkbox to disable or enable the filter for banned grades of 'ware in create mode. When selecting the cyberware, you will not be permitted to add the item if the grade is in the banned list.
- Altered requirements checker to test for submersion grade and echo limitations.
- Fixed a crash when attempting to create spells.
- Fixed spells in create mode not working properly with Limited, Extended and Alchemical settings.
- Fixed an issue with WeaponCategoryDV improvements such as Critical Strike not properly applying to Unarmed Combat-linked weapons.
- Fixed an issue in which items with no accessory mounts would cause a generation issue when using non-English strings.
- Fixed an issue with the XML amendment system that prevented new nodes from being added to the parent object. The main affected entry for this involves Adapsin; characters using this bioware should Reapply Improvements.
- Fixed an issue with the id node checker that prevented it from properly checking items with ids that were not specifically grandparents of the root chummer node in an xml file (e.g. Metavariants, Life Modules).
- Fixed issues with the karma value calculator when calculating the karma value of MAG and the karma value of attributes on shapeshifters.
- Fixed a bug where only the first specialization was indented in the Shadowrun 5 character sheet set. Fixes #2253.
- Added a dropdown menu option to bulk-add contacts, enemies and pets from a given XML file. To use this, create an XML file that contains valid contacts from an existing Chummer file, or alter this template: https://pastebin.com/W9q8jEnt Note that this system is designed to import ALL valid contacts in the file, irrespective of whether you click on Contacts or Enemies.
- Fixed a bug where requirement nodes reliant on having a certain number of spells from a category would not get processed correctly.
- Implemented a house rule to control whether the karma gained from enemies counts against your Negative Quality limit in create mode.
- The Translator will now process paragons, vessels, and mods for vehicle weapon mounts.
- Fixed issues regarding the translation, deletion, and selling of mods to vehicle weapon mounts and weapons added to mods of vehicle weapon mounts.
- Fixed issues loading characters made with gameplay options that are not present in the current dataset.
- Fixed a typo where the character validity checker would display unspent skill group points as unspent special attribute points.
- Metatype, attributes, and special attributes priority categories now also support gameplayoptions-specific choices.
- Fixed a crash when loading characters in career mode that have access to the Spells and Spirits tab, but don't have a Tradition.
- Metatypes for pets/cohorts are now alterable as a combobox if there is no character linked to a given pet/cohort. The suggested values loaded for the combobox are populated based on content in critters.xml. Fixes #2269.
- Added a menu option in Create mode to change your existing Options file choice. It is still strongly recommended that you create your custom options file before making any characters in order to ensure that all options are adhered to correctly, but in most cases anything weird will get caught by the next save/load.
- Fixed an issue where characters' trust fund-enabled lifestyles would be kept free after they lose their trust found source.
- Fixed a bug where characters with Ex-Con could still buy (non-modular) Restricted and/or Forbidden 'ware. Getting Ex-Con in Create mode will now remove all ineligible 'ware from the character, and getting Ex-Con in Career mode will do the same for all 'ware that does not have a "None" grade (so e.g. genemods are kept).
- Fixed a bug where characters with Erased did not have their Public Awareness capped to 1.
- Fixed a bug where losing the Overclocker quality would not remove the overclocked benefit from affected gear.
- Fixed a crash in the Translator when a user attempts to search for an item while having no cell selected.
- Fixed an issue where Redliner would not trigger off of modular full cyberlimbs. Fixes #2275.
- Implemented a proof-of-concept system for extracting text from the sourcebook for a given object. Currently only works with qualities that are being created, because string manipulation with unreliable formats is annoying. If you can think of a reliable way to parse paragraphs out of a plaintext block, feel free to let me know.
- Fixed an issue where knowledge hardwires would not let the user choose a knowledge skill.
- Added an invite link to the Chummer Discord to the help menu toolstrip.
- Fixed an issue with loading the Black Market Discount property. Existing characters will need to reapply improvements to fix it. 
- Fully implemented the automatic system for Black Market Pipeline to apply to all valid object types (Armor, Armor Mod, Bio/Cyberware, Gear, Vehicles, Vehicle Mods, Weapons). Weapon Accessories don't use the category system that this binds to, so another solution will need to be found for them. I'm unsure what to bind most of the Gear categories to, so I've just been rather generous with Drugs and Electronics for now. 
- Fixed a crash when selecting a character with a 'None' metavariant in the roster. Shouldn't happen, but just in case.
- Fixed an issue where the Life Modules root node would not get translated.
- Added a warning prompt about Life Modules not being fully supported when enabling the relevant option.
- Fixed an issue where clicking on a cell under the "Browse" tab in the armor selection screen would result in that armor getting added to the character. Fixes #2303.
- Fixed a bug where restoring essence to a character would also restore lost special attribute values.
- Chummer5a will now use the number localization of the currently loaded language (if possible) instead of that of the user's system.
- Added the option to remove a quantity of gear other than 1 in Career mode.
- Added a Matrix Condition Monitor to the Weapons tab.

Data Changes:

- Fixed Virtual Machine so that it can hold 2 cyberprograms (for when proper support for cyberprogram handling is added).
- Data lock cyberware will now display its proper Matrix attributes, i.e. with a Device Rating equal to its rating instead of being based off of its grade.
- Implemented priority mode requirements for shapeshifters. 
- Added a missing bonus to The Magician's Way quality that prevented it from granting discounted powers.
- Corrected the code of the Japanese localization to ja-JP (from jp-JP).
- Fixed Berserker's Rage being eligible for a PP discount under The Spiritual Way. Part of #2180.
- Fixed a crash caused by a typo in Thundercloud Morgan's weapon mounts. Fixes #2183.
- Fixed being able to change the spirit category of Summoning, Binding, and Banishing foci.
- The Spiritual Way now allows discounting the following powers that were previously missed: Heightened Concentration, Spirit Ram, Nimble Fingers, Metabolic Control, Magic Sense, Kinesics Mastery, Traceless Walk, Pain Resistance, Improved Physical Attribute.
- The Ultimax Carbine has been converted back to using its actual stats from Gun H(e)aven 3, as no official errata has ever been released for it. An amend entry has been added to the SR Missions 1.4 Rules customdata folder, and a separate entry has been added for users that want to treat Missions as official errata for it. Characters that already have this weapon should not be affected, but I'd recommend enabling the rule if you intend to reapply improvements or purchase a new one at some point.
- Fixed Karma values for qualities from Dark Terrors.
- Fixed being unable to buy Flex Hand if the user had bought any cyberarms. Fixes #2202.
- Removed extra recoil compensation from the Walther P118.
- Old weapon mount mods have been flagged as hidden.
- Added missing improvement to the Burnout's Way quality that allowed the replacement Grade to show up properly. Existing characters will need to remove and re-add the quality or use the Reapply Improvements menu.
- Added default banned grades to the default gameplayoptions.xml entries. 
- Fixed incorrect categories for the Claw and Barrage spells.
- Implemented the Gyro-Stabilization vehicle mod as a customdata entry per the entry in the German version of Rigger 5.0. This file will be merged into the main file if the mod ever gets erratad into the English version.
- Fixed a bug where the incorrect message was displayed if someone exceeded their maximum amount of negative metagenetic qualities. Fixes #2225.
- Fixed a bug where loading a character in create mode who had more priority points spent in an attribute than their attribute maximum would cause Chummer to crash. Fixes #2222.
- Fixed incorrect page reference for Rockblood Signature Armored Shirt. Fixes #2233.
- Implemented the Hedge Witch and Elementalist Focused Awakened as qualities. 
- Implemented the bonus for the Structured Spellcasting metamagic.
- Fixed a duplicate id in the Pomorya Nationality Life Module.
- Fixed incorrect category for Ford Titan. Fixes #2262.
- Fixed an issue where characters could take the Trust Fund quality multiple times.
- Fixed an issue where players could add audio and vision enhancement gear to cyberears and cybereyes respectively (they should be restricted to 'ware plugins only), but could not add sensors or custom gear item plugins. Existing characters with cyberears and cybereyes will need to re-add the affected 'ware in order to benefit from this fix.
- Added missing id nodes to vessels in vessels.xml.
- Fixed an issue where characters were limited to only one active hardwire and one knowledge hardwire. Fixes #2289.
- Fixed the Growth spell having "Special" as its drain code instead of F+3.
- Added an amend entry to convert the Growth spell to the version used by the German version of Forbidden Arcana.
- Corrected "The Seattle Gauntlet" to "The Seattle Gambit".

- Fixed display of nuyen karma cost in the karma cost summary to not switch to the actual nuyen value. 
- Fixed quirks with attribute point warnings when moving to career mode. 
- Fixed an issue when loading critters that caused them to have lower attribute values than intended.
- Added backend support for wireless bonuses to Gear, Armor, Armor Mods, Vehicle Mods, and Cyberware.
- Fixed an issue where lifestyle qualities would not have closing square brackets for their costs.
- Altered the Limit Spirit Selection bonus so that it also adds to its selection to the bonus' source. This also makes Apprentice indicate the both the chosen spirit type and the chosen spell category.
- Fixed an issue that allowed priority choices that received a single skill or skill group to receive multiples.
- Fixed incorrect costs for binding foci when using non-English language files.
- Fixed an issue with free spells from Dedicated Spellslinger improperly prompting for Karma in career mode.
- Fixed archaic handling of how restrictions are applied to bonus Adept powers by adding a "bonus override" portion to bonuses that add specific Adept powers with certain restrictions (e.g. specifically free levels in Attribute Boost AGI instead of in any Attribute Boost).
- Fixed a bug where bonuses granting free levels of certain adept powers, e.g. Improved Ability, would not actually have their effect applied, and would also not have their effect properly removed if the source of the bonus was removed.
- Made minor performance optimization to code that constructs the dicepool tooltips for skills.
- The "Select Skill" form can now process multiple skill group inclusions, skill group exclusions, and skill category inclusions the same way it does for multiple skill inclusions (the old way of handling multiple skill category inclusions still works). It can also handle multiple filters at once, e.g. list only Physical Skills that are linked to STR, or list all Social Skills excluding the ones in the Acting skill group.
- Fixed a bug that prevented bonuses granting free levels of certain powers from updating values boosted by said powers. Fixes #1834 and #1856.
- Fixed a bug that made removing items that granted free levels of adept powers sometimes not actually remove the improvements added by said adept powers.
- Fixed a bug that allowed the deletion of some powers without levels that were granted by free levels of adept powers.
- Maximum values for adept powers should now update properly with changes to MAG values, and in the case of Improved Ability, changes to skill ratings.
- Cancelling out of a dialog triggered by selecting an adept power or a property of an adept power will now properly cancel the dialog and not actually add the last/default selected choice.
- Added support for skill selection dialogs to be able to only show skills for which the runner has a rating greater than or equal to a pre-defined rating and/or less than or equal to a pre-defined rating. In case there are no eligible options, a warning dialog is displayed, and the skill selection dialog is automatically treated as cancelled.
- Added support for bonuses to defense dice (e.g. Combat Sense, Reakt).
- Added support for Barehanded Adept and qualities similar to it.
- Drain for Physical Adepts is now properly displayed and calculated as BOD + WIL.
- Reapply Improvements will now start by clearing out all improvements that it would reapply, regardless of source names. This helps clean out old .chum5 saves that have orphaned improvements, which fixes #1916.
- Chummer5 will now warn users when it does not have the proper write permissions to its own folder, or if an error was encountered that prevented a character from being saved. Fixes #1915.
- The "Buy Specialization with Karma" checkbox is now also automatically checked if buying a specialization for a skill that was ranked up with skill group points.
- Added support for qualities that can be purchased with spell points instead of karma at chargen.
- Added support for essence penalty improvements that only affect MAG, as well as essence penalty improvements that have hundredths-level precision instead of integer precision.
- Fixed a bug where the optional rule that allows Mystic Adept PPs to be bought with priority spell points also allowed purchasing of PPs with free spell points given by Dedicated Spellslinger.
- Requirements that check for whether MAG, RES, or DEP are >= 1 will now instead check for if the corresponding attribute is enabled.
- When adding adept powers, the list of available adept powers will hide powers whose prerequisites are not met.
- Added support for any attribute or special attribute to be used in a weapon's damage code.
- Fixed Character Validity Checker not properly counting attribute points and special attribute points. Fixes #1917.
- Fixed Character Validity Checker not counting vehicle mod slot modifiers when checking vehicle mods are over capacity. Fixes #1875.
- Fixed attribute points, special attribute points, and displayed metatype limits not updating if/when metatype limits are changed. Fixes #1912.
- Added support for the following requirements (to qualities): the item can only be taken during character generation, the item cannot be bought separately in priority-based character generation methods.
- Added support for qualities that refund their cost when removed in career mode. The fact that such a quality can be bought for its normal price in chargen and then refunded for double its price in career mode is working as intended, as per rules for swapping Latent Dracomorphosis for a Drake quality.
- "Don't Show Metagenetic Qualities" is automatically checked when choosing qualities for characters without any SURGE quality.
- Added support for setting a different quality (and other item) count limit when the quality would be taken at chargen.
- Added support for including other quality names when checking against the quality count limit. Also added support to set the total limit when including differently named qualities to something different from the main limit for the quality itself (e.g. Tough as Nails has an individual limit of 3 per Condition Monitor type, but the total limit of Physical + Stun versions of Tough as Nails is 4).
- Set the default quality count limit to 1 instead of Unlimited.
- Added support for bonuses that disable dicepool bonuses from specializations for a selected or specific skill
- Fixed a bug where Dealer Connection could be taken multiple times for the same category.
- Fixed a bug where the categories in Dealer Connection could not be localized.
- Qualities added by improvements (e.g. Poor Self Control Thrill Seeker for Daredrenaline) can no longer be deleted unless the source of the improvement is removed. The source of the improvement will also be printed with the quality on character sheets.
- Multiple instances of the same quality will get combined into one entry. For example, 3 entries for "Social Appearance Anxiety" will get combined into "Social Appearance Anxiety 3". Qualities from different source types will not stack in this way. 
- Fixed a bug where qualities to be added from an improvement would not be added if an instance of the quality already exists. This should e.g. allow Daredrenaline to properly represent its effects if the runner already has Poor Self Control Thrill Seeker.
- Also added a numerical up-down control to quickly add or remove multiple instances of the same quality.
- Added support for a quality to only apply certain bonuses at its first level.
- Fixed a bug where newly added items would not cancel themselves if a quality that their bonus added could not be taken for the character.
- Adept powers without and Adept way discount specified can no longer cause crashes.
- Magician's Way now works via blacklist instead of whitelist: all powers that have Adept way discounts and that are not specified that Magician's Way is forbidden from getting them discounted will always be eligible for a Magician's Way discount. Fixes #1926.
- Fixed a bug where the Spells & Spirits tab would not appear for Adepts who would want to or have already learned Rituals or spells through Barehanded Adept. Fixes #1933.
- Added support to display alternate ranges for weapons in addition to their main ranges. Fixes #1807.
- Altered Create mode and Career mode windows to have identical dimensions and identical splits. Altered Weapon and Vehicle tabs in Create and Career mode both to largely match each other's layout and make room for alternate ranges.
- Fixed a possible crash if a Resonance talent priority was defined with no free Complex Forms.
- Fixed wonky behavior if skill value and a skill group value items were added to a talent priority. Now, skill value always takes complete precedence over skill group value.
- Added support for talent priorities that give bonus special attribute points.
- Fixed an issue where having multiple mugshots could cause the main mugshot to get overwritten when creating a character sheet.
- Added proper support for mugshots of any arbitrary size to be properly displayed. Removed Label_MugshotDimensions and its related label because it is now redundant. Due to wonkiness with how Internet Explorer handles resizing images, it is still recommended that you save to HTML first and then print your sheet from within a browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Also, larger mugshots considerably increase the size of savefiles, so be reasonable.
- Added support for improvements that add bonus dice to a particular weapon category.
- Fixed the updater and "Restart Application" not working properly if Chummer5's exe was renamed.
- Made a minor refactor of the ImprovementManager. On the user side, fetching of improvement-boosted values should be significantly faster.
- When values of improvements are fetched, precedence0 and precedence1 items will now check the total value of items without precedence, and if they are less than the latter, they will not override it. Fixes #1231.
- Added support for the inclusion of adept powers and critter powers in requirements lists.
- Added support for CM threshold offset improvements that are shared between Physical and Stun tracks. Note that these are always cumulative with regular CM threshold improvements.
- The category of all knowledge skills are now saved with the character. Fixes #1670, fixes #1624.
- Fixed a bug where knowledge skill purchased in Create mode could have their category changed in Career mode if they were not advanced with karma. Fixes #1773.
- Fixed notes in Skills and Calendar not obeying the Print Notes option.
- Fixed Fancy Blocks character sheet so that its blocks no longer cut across pages and its page break options work properly. Fixes #1018.
- All items, including sourcebooks, will now always obey the <hide /> element and never show up in any browsing or selection lists if they are tagged as such. In the case of enabled sourcebooks, they become disabled when hidden.
- Fixed a bug where Select Skill Specialization, Select Skill, Select Exotic Skill, Select Cyberware Suite, and Select Critter Power did not obey rules for what sourcebooks were enabled.
- The message that warns of missing sourcebooks when a character is loaded is now localizable.
- Added the ability to amend items instead of completely overriding them. When amending items, only nodes that are present in the amended node will overwrite or add to older data. Tags can also be removed this way by adding the 'remove="yes"' attribute to an element in an amending node. An ID and/or a Name field must be specified for all items regardless, as that is how the system identifies what data to amend. Sub-elements with children that also have ID and/or Name fields (e.g. metavariants lists inside metatype entries) will be treated the same way as their parents, i.e. only nodes present in the amending file will be overwritten, added, or removed.
- Added the ability to load and set any custom data directory as a custom ruleset. Once added, these data directories will be saved to a list and can be toggled the same way as sourcebooks. Entries with invalid directory paths will be removed on startup, and if someone is running Chummer for the first time or has only invalid directory paths, Chummer will automatically populate the custom data directory list with each folder it finds in the "customdata" folder (they all start disabled).
- Fixed detection of Burnout's Way when combined with Adapsin.
- Added an option in the Select Gear dialog to only show items that the character can currently afford.
- Select Armor, Select Cyberware, Select Bioware, Select Gear, Select Vehicle, and Select Weapon screens now all have a category that shows all items, and searching for items on those screens will now only search within the selected category. In the case of Select Cyberware and Select Bioware screens, the current selection will be saved when switching between grades and selecting a particular grade will automatically hide all items that cannot be taken in that grade. Selecting the Cultured Bioware category when the Used grade is selected will switch the selected grade back to Standard.
- An Optional Rule has been provided (Search In Category Only) that will disable the whitelisting based on category, which is enabled by default. It can be disabled in General Options under Miscellaneous. 
- The Select Cyberware screen will now only display Cyberlimb Customizations and Cyberlimb Enhancements when adding a subsystem to a cyberlimb.
- Fixed a bug where cost modifiers were not properly applied to gear with FixedValue costs.
- Removed references to <cost3>, <cost6>, <cost10>, <avail3>, <avail6>, and <avail10> nodes, as they are obsolete. Added a legacy shim to handle these entry types from savefiles and convert them to just using <cost> and <avail> respectively.
- Added support for bonuses that remove the ability to add cyberware, remove the ability to add bioware, or modify the essence cost of bioware or cyberware in a way that stacks multiplicatively with other modifiers instead of additively.
- Added a houserule option to allow skill points to be used to buy specializations for karma-bought skills.
- Added support for mixing of special cost and availability expressions. For example, one can now mix "FixedValues()" with "Parent Cost" and Chummer5 should know how to handle it. 
- Added support for using expressions to define Attack, Sleaze, Data Processing, Firewall, and Device Rating.
- Altered commlink system and related UI so that gear with the attributesarray tag is treated as being able to swap its Matrix attributes, while those without it cannot.
- Altered commlink system so that any gear with a devicerating tag is marked and treated as a commlink, rather than it being hardcoded to a few, specific categories.
- Added support for gear that modifies Matrix attributes, both in terms of modifying a cyberdeck array and in terms of modifying a specific Matrix attribute. Commlinks and cyberdecks modify their Matrix attributes by their children's stats.
- Added support for essence cost modifiers (additively stacking multipliers) and total essence cost modifiers (multiplicatively stacking multipliers) that do not retroactively alter existing cyberware's essence costs.
- Added support for cyberware to come with built-in gear.
- Vehicles, weapons, armor mods, weapon accessories, and cyberware that are added by gear and/or cyberware or are included in their parents are now all colored gray when without notes and can no longer be removed without removing their parents. The Unarmed Attack entry in the weapons list can never be removed and is always colored gray if there are no notes attached.
- Added support for gear that modifies its parent's Matrix condition monitor.
- If an item has a higher rating than the number of entries in an attribute it has that uses a FixedValue() system, then Chummer5 will select the last item instead of crashing.
- Standardized the code to retrieve an item's XML entry. As a side effect, some translation issues have been fixed.
- Added support for the usegears sections of gear entries to start with their node collapsed, added support to define new source and page entries to usegear entries, and added support to make each usegear entry to not create the item's default children and/or not apply the item's improvements. Gear that is marked as "do not apply improvements" when created will also not have its children create improvements.
- When a Custom Item entry is added as a default child of another item, it will no longer prompt the user to enter a price (it will always be 0), and if the select attribute in the entry's name tag is set, then that value will be the Custom Item's name as well.
- Added support for gear that lets users choose between a selection of default children, via the <choosegear></choosegear> attributes. Each set of those tags inside of <gears></gears> is one choice that the user can make, and the user must choose between one of the <usegear></usegear> entries within each <choosegear></choosegear>.
- Added support to tag gear as requiring a parent to be added, i.e. to mark the gear as an enhancement or plugin item.
- Increased the size of the Rating box in SelectGear to accommodate larger ratings e.g. that credsticks might have.
- Fixed a bug where selecting the "All" category in the form to select vehicle mods did not adhere to the category limit selection if one was set.
- Fixed the "Hide Items Over Avail Limit" option on the vehicle mods selection screen so that it actually hides mods that are over the availability limit when checked.
- Fixed a bug where having a positive essence score of less than 0.01 (in case the number of essence decimal places is set to 3 or greater) would mark the character as invalid for career mode. Fixes #1951.
- Removed the piece of code that selected all text in Translator's search box whenever focus was gained to it. Fixes #1945.
- Added Bubble Die option to dice roller that fixes glitch chances on even-numbered dicepools. When rolling an even-numbered dicepool with it enabled, an extra, "bubble" die is rolled for the purposes of determining whether the test glitches or not. This causes glitch chances for even-numbered pools are no longer be ridiculously low: pools of 0 have the same glitch chances as pools of 1, pools of 2 have the same glitch chances as pools of 3, so on.
- Corrected the code that calculates weapon dicepool for drones in Career mode. Also added identical functionality to Create mode.
- Corrected a bug where re-rolling failures in the dice roller would ignore the "rush job" checkbox.
- Corrected a bug where the dice roller determined glitches to occur when at least half of the dicepool are 1s (RAW requires more than half of the dicepool to be 1s).
- Upgraded the random number generator used for dice rolling from a Linear Congruential RNG to a Mersenne Twister RNG. This should drastically reduce the "patterns" one might see in random results, as those "patterns" come about as a result of the very low quality of randomness of Linear Congruential RNGs.
- Fixed a bug where adding an item (e.g. a quality or adept power) that grants critter powers will not cause those critter powers to be removed should the item be removed. Fixes #1953.
- Fixed a bug that caused bonuses that increased a skill's rating to act the same way as bonuses to the skill's dicepool, e.g. karma costs would not increase and specializations could not be taken if the skill had no points or karma allocated to increasing its rating. Fixes #1743.
- Fixed a bug that prevented knowledge skills from having their names translated when printed out to a character sheet. Fixes #1668.
- Added set of improvements that can disable access to specific grades of bioware and cyberware. These limits are bypassed for all 'ware that forces a particular grade, so any restrictions in those cases need to be applied to the specific piece of 'ware in question.
- Fixed the "Hide Items Over Avail Limit" checkbox so that it displays the availability limit of the character in parentheses instead of the default availability value.
- Added the ability for pre-installed subsystems in cyberare to include bioware and pre-installed subsystems in bioware to include cyberware. Added the ability for pre-installed cyberware and bioware subsystems to come with their own pre-installed gear and pre-installed subsystems.
- Restrictions via the <forbidden> and <required> tags for bioware and cyberware will now also check subsystems, not just top-level cyberware and bioware.
- Fixed names for improvement sources originating from nested cyberware, bioware, and gear not showing up properly.
- Fixed bonuses for nested 'ware not getting removed when the parent is removed if the given piece of 'ware is a grandchild or later descendant of the 'ware getting removed.
- Fixed a bug that caused 'ware grades to not obey the enabled sourcebook rules, e.g. Omegaware would show up even if Chrome Flesh was not enabled.
- Fixed a bug where the Power selection dialog allowed the user to select a power that was marked as hidden or was from a sourcebook that the user did not have enabled.
- Unhardcoded Cultured bioware's restriction from Used grade. Now any piece of bioware or cyberware can be marked as being ineligible for Used grade.
- If Chummer5 encounters an error while loading improvements from a savefile, it will now continue loading the character instead of crashing, and it will prompt the user to re-apply the problematic improvements when the character is loaded.
- Added a new item in the Special options menu that calculates the total karma value of a character during character creation.
- Fixed a prompt for modications to items when browsing the Select Armor window.
- Fixed an incorrect Karma cost change when using the Improved Ability (skill) power in create mode. 
- Fixed display of karma costs for skills in create mode to not show Karma twice.
- Fixed the Updater crashing when a .pdb file or .exe file is in use. Also made the updater display a permissions warning if it cannot rename or remove old files instead of having it crash.
- Fixed Home Node-based stat calculation issues for AIs. The presence of a home node and any stats calculated from it will now be handled correctly. Fixes #1963.
- Added support for up to 3 free skills to be selected from priorities. If more than 3 skills are defined in a priority entry, Chummer5 will now display the first 3 instead of displaying none. Fixes #1964.
- Fixed a crash when using Re-apply Improvements while having qualities that add other qualities.
- Adding multiple instances of overlapping SpecialSkills improvements will no longer duplicate skills, and removing a SpecialSkills improvement will no longer remove skills if another SpecialSkills improvement still exists that would enable the same skills. Fixes #1513.
- Fixed the Improvements manager not properly detecting some cases of cancelled dialogs. Fixes #1830.
- Fixed a null reference stack overflow if launching Chummer for the first time without a Sourcebook key in the registry. 
- Fixed a null reference when selecting weapons with built-in gear.
- Fixed a bug where trying to change the quantity of a gear plugin in Create mode would not work.
- Added support for costs, gear quantities, and gear capacities that are not integers. All nuyen costs should now be tracked to decimal precision (precision depends on how large the number is), though Chummer5 will only display up to 2 decimal places.
- Updated the tool that saves character sheets to PDF so that it shouldn't mess up sheet formatting as much as the previous one.
- Slightly altered the UI for the quality selection window so that it is clearer what the numerical up-downs in it represent. Fixes #1971.
- Fixed a bug that caused the dicepool for resisting physical illusion spells to be calculated as WIL + WIL and displayed as INT + WIL instead of the LOG + INT that it should be.
- Added support for tracking of fatigue resistance, dicepools for addiction tests (physiological, psychological, both in the "not yet addicted" and "already addicted" variety), resistance and/or immunity to toxins (in all four vectors), resistance and/or immunity to pathogens (in all four vectors), natural physical CM recovery, and natural stun CM recovery. All of these stats are now printed with the Print() method, so character sheets can integrate them into their displays.
- Added support for the following bonuses: extra fatigue resistance dice, extra dice for addiction (physiological, psychological, both in the "not yet addicted" and "already addicted" variety), extra resistance and/or immunity to toxins (in all four vectors), extra resistance and/or immunity to pathogens (in all four vectors), extra natural physical CM recovery, extra natural stun CM recovery, the toggling of adding Essence as bonus dice to natural physical and/or stun CM recovery, bonus dice to resist mental and/or physical manipulation spells, bonus dice to resist mana and/or physical illusion spells, bonus dice to resist detection spells, bonus armor against fire damage, bonus armor against cold damage, bonus armor against electricity damage, bonus armor against acid damage, bonus armor against falling damage, extra radiation resistance dice, extra sonic attack resistance dice, extra dice specifically to resist Judge Intentions, and extra dice specifically for initiating Judge Intentions tests. All existing items that should contain one or more of these bonuses have also been updated.
- Items that are set to require a certain amount of 'ware grade in essence now properly works with Burnout's Way and Adapsin.
- Fixed a bug where the initiative roller would calculate initiative with a flat probability distribution instead of with one mirroring the rolling of multiple dice (i.e. binomial-esque).
- Dice Roller will now display the sum of the dice results (disregarding bubble dice) under the information about whether the roll was a success, a failure, a glitch, and/or a critical glitch.
- Fixed a bug where bioware subsystems would always add to their parent's essence. This is now instead controlled by a separate tag instead of reliant on 'ware type.
- Fixed a bug where cyberware and bioware that cost 0 essence but take up capacity when added to a cyberlimb (e.g. cortex bombs) would not show up in the list of standalone 'ware to add.
- Fixed Detection spell defense being shown as INT + REA instead of LOG + WIL.
- Adept Way discounts for foci should now be automatically detected in Career mode.
- Made the reference in for Life Module Selection clickable.
- Added support for printing of skill groups. Added skill group printing to Fancy Blocks and the Shadowrun 5 character sheet sets.
- Added a separate section for storing conditions of certain Improvements. Added support for conditions to the specificskill bonus tag.
- Fixed a bug where removing improvements that gave martial arts, spells, qualities, or critter powers would not remove improvements associated with the given item.
- Fixed a bug where Chummer5 would calculate incorrect movement speed values from cyberlegs if the option was enabled but only one cyberleg was present.
- Added backend support for cyberware bonuses that only activate per pair instead of per discrete piece.
- Fixed a bug where cyberware added to vehicles did not allow for subsystems to be added to it.
- Fixed issues with skill dicepool tooltips not properly recognizing improvement sources from cyberware, nested 'ware, armor, armor mods, martial arts advantages, critter powers, and nested gear (including ones inside weapons, armor, armor mods, weapon accessories, cyberware, and vehicles).
- Movement speeds should now properly display decimal values (e.g. "4/8, 1.5m/hit") when applicable.
- Fixed a crash when adding an item with over 1,000 capacity in a culture using a decimal comma. Fixes #1983.
- Allowed for full localization of the updater, added a label to indicate whether the user is running the latest version of Chummer5 that is available on their chosen update channel (stable or nightly), and force-disabled the Download button if they are running what is the latest version of their chosen update channel (the button isn't disabled if they're running the latest nightly, but switched update channels to stable). Fixes #1977.
- Fixed being unable to select underbarrel weapons for SelectWeapon bonuses (e.g. picking a weapon for Spare Clips).
- Fixed an issue with items that use the SelectWeapon improvement type passing an internal ID rather than the Name of the weapon.
- Crash Dumper will no longer crash when it cannot connect to an upload service, and it will prompt the user to manually submit an issue to GitHub with the attached minidump.
- Transformed the GlobalOptions, LanguageManager, and XmlManager classes into fully static classes. For users, this also produces a measurable performance increase and a decrease in the size of Chummer5's executable.
- Fixed a bug related to selecting the default, blank entry in the Traditions dropdown combobox and then trying to add a spell.
- Allowed Edge to be burned to zero. Fixes #1989.
- Allowed filtering for skills that use any attribute, in case custom data adds any that are linked to DEP or ESS.
- Swimming should no longer show up as a skill to characters who cannot swim or have special Swimming rules, and Running should not show up as a skill to characters who cannot move on land or have special rules for land movement.
- Fixed a bug where the option that enables education qualities' karma discount at chargen causes every second level to be free instead of decreasing the karma cost of raising skill ratings by 1.
- Skill-based item requirement nodes can now process exotic skills.
- Fixed a bug where specializations could be bought for skills that only had ratings from skillsofts.
- Fixed a bug where the button to increase a knowledge skill in career mode would be clickable/enabled even when the knowledge skill could not actually be increased.
- Fixed an issue where martial arts technique names would not get properly translated.
- One Trick Pony will now automatically load any new techniques added to Chummer5 without having to update the quality's art's entry.
- Added the ability for limits to items to include attributes, base attributes, and limb counts. Also added the ability to resolve XPath operations in them.
- Added the ability for bonuses to add extra limbs. Shiva Arms (Pair) has been updated to reflect this, and the centaur metavariant starts with a new quality that adds two leg limbs.
- Fixed a bug where children of 'ware with a particular side (left or right) would not automatically inherit the side of their parent.
- Fixed a bug where Reapply Improvements would not reapply improvements from some nested gear and nested cyberware.
- Selecting the side of a piece of 'ware is now independent from selecting other bonuses. For example, this means custom cyberfingers will display both their custom function and the side to which they were added.
- Fixed a bug where the cyberware/bioware selection screen would not properly consider 'ware requirements.
- Fixed a bug where the technique from One Trick Pony would not be included in the limit of 5 techniques at character generation.
- Added preliminary handling of modular cyberlimbs. Modular cyberlimbs for vehicles need to be bought through the Cyberware tab and then equipped from there. There are some parts of the current implementation that rely on non-RAW rules because there is no way around it without being insane (e.g. modular limbs don't add essence, all essence is added via connectors); this is subject to change with official errata.
- KnowledgeSkillPoints Spent over the limit in Karma/Life Module are no longer subtracted from (non-existent) active SkillPoints. Instead the remaining points are negative and prevent crossing over to career mode.
- KnowledgeSkill with price reuction qualities (Linguist, College Education, etc) no longer have negative Karma cost.
- Fixed a bug where if knowledge skills are bought with karma in create mode, and the cost for buying new knowledge skills is set to a different value (in the options menu) from the cost of improving them, Chummer5 would not recognize that it needs to use the "new knowledge skill" cost for the first level instead of the "improve knowledge skill" cost.
- Fixed a crash caused by loading old character save files whose options do not have some of the categories looked for in newer versions of Chummer.
- Fixed a weird cutoff of the controls of some adept powers.
- Added a legacy shimmer that should catch and convert old cases of Improved Reflexes adept power to the new system, as these would not be fixed with Reapply Improvements.
- The mouse cursor will now change to "Waiting" mode while a character is being loaded in or while a character is getting their improvements re-applied.
- Re-apply improvements will now collect the names of outdated items and warn the user at the end to manually re-add them and/or to make sure they have all custom data files that they were previously using still present.
- Fixed a bug where bonuses that let you select an attribute would not record the choice in their parent item.
- Added code to properly fetch the data GUIDs of qualities in old save files made before quality GUIDs were saved, and added code to make sure qualities without data GUIDs would return an empty string when the data GUID is fetched instead of a GUID that corresponds to the empty GUID.
- Unhardcoded the entry for Technomancer Living Personas. It can now be modified via a gear entry that corresponds to it, and it can be set to be the active the same way a commlink can.
- Added the ability for bonuses to add gear.
- Added support for gear entries where altering quantities is not allowed.
- Matrix attributes will now automatically fill in the Data Processing value of the character's active commlink.
- Fixed a bug where removing Black Market Pipeline would not reset the discounted cost of nested gear.
- Fixed a bug where loading in certain gear would not properly color their entries based on the presence of notes and whether or not they can be removed.
- Character sheet language can now be selected in a dropdown menu instead of it being forced to just English sheets and sheets for the currently set language. Fixes #2018.
- Fixed a bug where the character validity checker would erroneously read maximum special attribute points as unspent special attribute points when deciding to show a warning about unspent special attribute points to the user. Fixes #2019.
- Fixed a bug where Re-Apply Improvements would not properly show newly populated items added by re-applied improvements.
- Fixed a bug where browsing weapons that came with accessories that came with gear that added bonuses would create a large list of "orphaned" improvements that would also show up when printing to a character sheet. Fixes #2013.
- Restored the ability to delete characters from the Character Roster by pressing Delete.
- Fixed a crash when adding stacking gear in career mode that occured if a stack already exists. Fixes #2026.
- Fixed a bug where manipulating stacking gear in career mode would not properly search through all children of an existing gear to make sure everything matches up before combining the two stacks.
- Fixed a bug where manipulating stacking gear that combines with an existing stack in career mode would not update the gear list entry of the existing stack if it was in a location other than the default one.
- Fixed a bug where trying to reload weapons in career mode would not allow use of ammo taken from a deeply nested location (i.e. it would only look one child deep).
- Changing languages in the Options menu now automatically re-populates the list of character sheets selectable as the default. If a non-English language is selected, only sheets for that language will show up.
- Fixed a bug where Chummer5 would only look at its first command line argument when seeing if it load characters at startup. Also fixes a bug where restarting Chummer5 after changing options with more than one character loaded would only load the first character after the restart.
- Fixed a bug where selecting to save changes to options but not to restart Chummer5 would not actually save changes to options.
- Fixed a bug where Chummer5 would not allow adding of alchemical preparations or ritual spells in create mode if the character was already at their character generation limit for regular skills. Fixes #2030.
- Fixed a bug where ritual spells could be taken as alchemical preparation recipes.
- Added the ability to check for the presence of a Martial Art in a required/forbidden node.
- Added the ability for Martial Arts and Martial Art Techniques to use required/forbidden nodes.
- Chummer5 no longer adds 1 to the minimum entry of ranges.
- Weapon range entries are now able to handle all attributes, and they are now able to process the "/" character as a division sign.
- Fixed the weapon select screen displaying a tooltip with placeholder text over all items except the source label. Fixes #2034.
- Fixed a crash when removing cyberware that doesn't exist in data XMLs.
- Fixed a problem with specialisations not being able to be purchased if you didn't have the exact amount of Karma required.
- If a name and an id element are both specified inside an override node, then the name element is only used as an addition identifier if it has the "isidnode" attribute set to "yes". Also added support for using any elements as identifiers in override nodes, again using the "isidnode" attribute and setting it to "yes". Fixes #2038.
- Cyber-singularity Seeker and Redliner will now properly update when the character is loaded, and adding or removing Redliner will automatically update labels for the currently selected cyberlimb. Fixes #2036.
- Added the ability to specify metatype, age, sex, personal life, service type, hobbies/vice, and preferred payment method to contacts. Any non-blank fields out of those seven will get printed in any character sheet using a template from the Shadowrun 5 collection.
- Added the ability to add gear to armor mods. For now, this is only used by Full Body Armor helmet. Fixes #2043.
- Fixed a bug where adding a new vehicle mod to a vehicle would not automatically update the character's stats (most noticeable with the nuyen display).
- Fixed a bug with trying to add Customized Strength and Customized Agility to drone limbs equipped on drones with Body 0 and Pilot 0 respectively.
- Fixed a bug where Customized Strength and Customized Agility could be set to ratings when added to a drone limb that would cause no net attribute change.
- Fixed a bug where cyberware subsystems that increase their parent's availability would not do so when installed in a drone limb.
- Fixed a bug where cyberlimb stats and cyberlimb customizations would not automatically update with changes to vehicle attributes in both career and create mode and with changes to character attribute maxima in create mode.
- In case the maximum rating for a piece of 'ware is less than the minimum rating for it, it will automatically be hidden from the menu of 'ware available for purchase. Removed the outright forbidding of Customized Strength for Pixies, as it is no longer necessary. This should now also enable Pixies with a maximum STR of 4 or higher (e.g. via Exceptional Attribute + Genetic Optimization) to purchase cyberlimbs with customized STR, and will automatically catch cases where someone's maximum STR/AGI dips to 3 or below (e.g. Aged, Infirm, Impaired Attribute).
- Implemented a new bonus type for Street Cred Multiplier, to be used by the Consumnate Professional quality. Fixes #2048
- Implemented a new bonus type for Street Cred, allowing Improvements to provide bonuses to Street Cred directly. Currently unused by anything.

- Fixed a bug where the updater form could not be re-opened after it has been closed once.
- Fixed crashes related to the user's connection to GitHub getting severed mid-update.
- Fixed the few-second delay encountered when launching the updater form.
- The optional rule for karma costs to increase special attributes not being decreased by essence loss now works and saves its value properly. It is implemented by having essence loss affect the attribute's augmented value instead of its maxima and minima, and characters burn out if their augmented reduction from essence loss becomes greater than their current maximum. Fixes #1808.
- Fixed a bug where tooltips for skill groups would not be updated properly.
- Fixed a bug where removing sources for special skills would not also remove skill groups.
- Fixed a bug where current priority settings would not get properly saved for if you wish to change priorities in create mode.
- Fixed a bug where removing/altering sources for free skill levels would not properly update the skill section with altered ratings. Fixes #1340.
- Fixed bugs where enabling the house rule for strict interpretation of skill group breaking in create mode would also affect characters in career mode.
- Fixed a bug where certain selectable bonuses and extras would not get translated when using a localization different from the default English (US) one.
- Fixed a bug where adding karma to an adept in career mode would sometimes cause sometimes Chummer5 to crash. Fixes #2050.
- Fixed the Automatic Updates option not working properly. The automatic updater has been updated as well to run silently in the background until an update is ready to be applied instead of forcing the user to click through an updater window. It also checks for updates every hour as well instead of just at startup. Manually checking for updates while the automatic updater is running in the background will make the visible updater window take over the automatic updater instead of trying to launch its own, separate instance of the updater.
- Fixed the warning for using an older version of Chummer5a to open a character made in a newer version.
- Fixed rare crashes for when certain strings had a null value instead of being empty. Possible fix for #2054.
- Fixed a bug where not having drone modding rules enabled caused the max armor for drones to be calculated as twice the drone's armor instead of the drone's armor + the drone's body.
- Fixed a bug where if Chummer5 encountered an error while saving a character, it would still assume that the character was saved properly.

- Checking the "Hide Items Over Availability Limit" checkbox will now also automatically set an item's maximum rating so that it cannot exceed the availability limit.
- Implemented the ability to rename the Extra text of Gear items with the selecttext improvement while in Career mode. This functionality will be extended to other categories (Weapons, Armour, etc.) as time permits.
- Character sheets are now printed with the number formatting of the language in which they are printed instead of with the number formatting of the language of the user's current operating system.
- Fixed a bug related to incorrect printing of certain numbers due to differences in decimal separators. Fixes #2069.
- Fixed a bug where some context menu strips would not get translated.
- Fixed a bug where Re-Apply Improvements would add improvements for items that were not equipped.

- Characters that did not properly assign a Type to their Knowledge skills will now be able to change it.

- Fixed the Guids of Skills and Skill Groups not being properly loaded from a saved character. Fixes #2081.
- Added the ability to directly add Armour to an Armor Bundle.
- Fixed a bug where buying a separate metamagic or enhancement in career mode would check against the karma cost of buying spells instead of the karma cost of getting a metamagic or enhancement respectively.
- Fixed a bug where wound modifiers were applied twice to knowledge skill dicepools.
- Fixed a bug where karma modifiers to spell cost where not factored into calculations regarding whether the character has enough karma to buy a new spell.
- Unhardcoded the karma cost modifications added by Uneducated, Uncouth, Myostatin Inhibitor, Jack of All Trades, College Education (RF), Linguist, School of Hard Knocks, and Technical School Education. These modifications are now available and fully modifiable through individual tags inside of bonus nodes.
- Transferred the house rule of education qualities applying their karma costs in create mode from a checkbox in the options menu to a custom ruleset. Users who had this rule previously enabled will need to re-enable it.
- Selecting an armor, a piece of 'ware, a gear, a quality, a vehicle, or a weapon now properly saves the currently selected value of the category selection box instead of the selected item's category. This does not apply if the search box is not empty and the option to search only in the selected category is disabled.
- Added support for improvements that block being able to buy specializations for particular skills or skill categories.
- Unhardcoded the focus bonding cost modification effects of Adept Ways, and unhardcoded the bonuses offered by Burnout's Way (access to Burnout's Way grade) and Magician's Way (can discount all powers other than Improved Reflexes). These effects are now available and fully modifiable through individual tags inside of bonus nodes.
- Focus bonding cost modifications from Adept Ways now be automatically applied in both Create and Career mode, and their karma effects will automatically be calculated by the time the user is prompted to spend karma on binding a new focus. Removed the numerical up-down in Create mode for the number of foci eligible for Adept Way discounts, as it is now obsolete.
- Fixed a bug where re-applying or re-adding improvements of items that would add the Improved Ability (skill) adept power would not properly end up adding that power.
- Fixed a bug where improvements that would ask the user to select an adept power to add would not abide by the "ignorerating" node when it was present.
- Added a house rule that changes Mystic Adepts so that instead of using special rules for obtaining and managing PP, they will have a separate MAG rating to be used for Adept powers and PP. Initiation and Foci will use the lower of the two MAG ratings if this rule is enabled.
- Fixed a bug where if points and/or karma were allocated to a special attribute to which access was later removed in Create mode, those points and/or karma would not get freed up.
- Weapons can now add more weapons (not just underbarreled weapons).
- Handedness now prints in a localized fashion, and will now display the appropriate value if the character is ambidextrous. Part of fix for #2098.
- Fixed translations for contact tabs and contact controls. Part of fix for #2098.
- Fixed weapon mount strings not being localized in the UI displaying info about a selected weapon. Part of fix for #2098.

- Added a house rule where characters can take an unlimited amount of Positive Qualities, but any quality karma costs in excess of the limit set in options are doubled, as if they were taken in career mode.
- Players may now alter starting karma and maximum karma-to-nuyen for characters in Create mode alongside altering maximum availability.
- Fixed a bug where the character sheet viewer screen from printing multiple characters would not allow any open characters to be changed, and would produce a blank sheet if the language was changed.
- Story Builder will now calculate the runner's age and birth year using the current year + 72 as the present year instead of it being fixed to 2075.
- Altered behaviour of the Made Man and Prime Datahaven Membership qualities to unbind forcing the Loyalty to 1/3 from being a Group.
- Added an option where Essence will not be rounded internally, only for display purposes. Technically, it will always be rounded to 28 decimal places if the option is enabled, as that is the maximum precision of the variable type used to store Essence and Essence costs.
- Added options for formatting how many decimal places are always displayed for Nuyen and how many places can possibly displayed in total. Chummer5a will always keep track of costs to 28 decimal places' worth of precision regardless of these options. Fixes #2094.
- Fixed issues regarding Enchantment spells not being properly added or re-added in certain cases.
- Fixed a bug where PACKS kits containing spells would add them to the wrong categories and would completely ignore Rituals and Enchantments.
- Added the ability to define custom karma costs for knowledge skill specializations different from active skill ones. Fixes #2113.
- Added the ability to define a custom flat cost for initiations and submersions instead of it being always set to 10.
- Fixed a bug where saving a character to a new file when the character's form would be closed due to Chummer wishing to restart itself would end up with Chummer not re-opening the character when it started back up.
- Added an option where changes to a character's savefile that happen outside of Chummer (e.g. via syncing folders in Dropbox) would make Chummer automatically reload the character's information if the character has no pending changes to be saved. Normally the user would have to watch for changes themselves and if there are any, they would have to close the character and then re-open them to load in any changes.
- Added a houserule where increasing the rating of a skill in a skill group when all the other skills have a higher rating compensates for the karma difference between increasing a skill group rating and increasing the rating of all skills in the skill group.
- Any and all GitHub contributors of past, present, and future are now immortalized in a list on the About screen.
- Moved Complex Form Context Menu Strip into the treenodes for each complex form to bring it back into line with the usual standard, removed it from the button.
- Fixed a crash when moving characters between the "Favorites" and "Recent" lists in the character roster.
- The "Favorites" list will now be shown in the character roster even when it is empty so that characters can immediately be moved to it.
- Double clicking a character on the character roster (or opening a character file linked to a contact, pet, or spirit) who is already open will now switch to the character's tab instead of attempting to open a new tab of the character. Open characters are now marked with an asterisk. If there are more than 10 characters open, open characters will still show up in the "Recent" list.
- Fixed a bug where testing a PDF inside the options menu would automatically save the currently selected options, which would cause them to be applied even if the user would choose not to apply changes to options in the prompt when they exited the options menu.
- Contacts, Pets, and Spirits linked to character files will automatically load those files in the background and fill in and update appropriate fields based on values in their linked file.
- Fixed a bug where pet metatypes/species labels in the Relationships tab were not translated properly.
- Added a proof-of-concept helper combobox that has a variable-width dropdown and tooltip functionality to assist with long text, such as sheet names in the options.
- Sheets printing free expenses is now something that can be toggled off in the options menu. Fixes #1800.
- Fixed a bug where having the Adapsin version of a grade for a piece of 'ware would cause it to not load the proper amount of Matrix Condition Monitor boxes.
- Fixed a bug where characters with Gammaware and/or the Adapsin versions of Betaware, Deltaware, and Gammaware would pass the character validity check for Career mode.
- Unhardcoded the device rating values of 'ware grades. They can now be modified with custom data files.
- Added the ability to perform a clean reinstall from within the updater.
- Added the ability to have Martial Arts with karma costs different from the default of 7.
- When warning about duplicate GUIDs in data files, Chummer5a will now display the names of the items to which those duplicate IDs belong.
- In addition to checking for duplicate GUIDs, Chummer5a will now also check for ID fields that do not contain GUIDs, and if it finds any, it will warn users in a manner similar to the warning for duplicate GUIDs.
- Fixed a bug where items that both consumed capacity and had capacity did not cause selection forms to enforce their maximum capacity remaining. Fixes #1806.
- The Shadowrun 5 character sheet set will now print the various resistance dicepools that the character has. Fixes #1935.

- Corrected the page number references of Forbidden Arcana mentor spirits.
- Spider (Alt) now properly gives 2 levels of Spirit Claw instead of 1. (Yes, Spirit Claw does not have levels, so Forbidden Arcana will need to be errata'd, but Chummer5 can handle this sort of thing regardless)
- Changed the name of "Great Mother" mentor spirit from SASS to "Great Mother (SASS)" to differentiate it from an identically named mentor spirit from Forbidden Arcana.

- When free spell points are available at chargen, and real spell costs (costs charged for the character) are not greater than unmodified spell costs (costs set in Options), all Mastery qualities from Forbidden Arcana will now deduct from spell points instead of from free karma at a rate of 1 point per [unmodified spell cost] karma, rounded down (so e.g. at 5 karma per spell, an 8 karma Mastery quality will cost 1 spell point and 3 karma instead of 8 karma).
- All Blood Crystal qualities now properly reduce both condition monitors by 1 for each bonded crystal. Crystal Breath, Crystal Eye, Crystal Gut, Crystal Jaw, Crystal Limb, and Crystal Spine now properly reduce Essence, but in a way that does not affect the character's MAG rating.

- Fixed a bug where Bulk Modification could be taken at a higher rating than is allowed for certain types of cyberlimbs.

- Fixed behaviour of the condition monitors to properly be checked and unchecked.

- Fixed behaviour of Lifestyle Names to properly show the name of the lifestyle type and the given lifestyle name.

- Moved the AddQualities improvement nodes for qualities, cyberware and such into the Bonus node. This shouldn't affect existing characters, but custom content will need to be adjusted to reflect the change.
- Moved the method for the SelectText improvement. I don't EXPECT that this will cause any issues, but if you encounter any odd behaviour please let us know.

- Fixed an issue that caused knowledge skills to revert their type to Interest. Fixes #1056.

Minor design note, I intend to eventually have every calculation variable kept outside of the application logic itself; this will allow GMs to configure their characters as they wish.

- Added a workaround to prevent crashes when loading characters with empty knowledge skills. Fixes #1099.

- The "ignoreprecedence" improvement attribute has been renamed to "precedence-1".

- Fixed an issue that prevented the Knowledge/Contact multiplier house rules from enabling correctly.
- Changed the string Tip_SkillsKnowledgeSkills to display the correct multiplier entry.

Data Changes:

Fixes #880.
- Fixed a bug where changing between technomancers and mages would leave both resonance and magical skills available. Fixes #890.

Build 180:
Application Change:
- Total rewrite of skills.
    * Eliminated a lot (all?) old bugs
    * Opening the skills tab first time is now signifigantly faster
    * Searchbox for skills
    * Custom sorting of skills. Sort by Rating, Dicepool, Category and more
    * Skill tooltip now display dicepools for cyberarms
    * In Career mode, it is possible to calculate the dicepool using another attribute that the default one.
    * Some minor UI changes to acomodate new skill features
    * Skills that cannot be defaulted has their name in italics.
    * Easier maintainance
    * Reduced file size
- First things first, good news bad news. Good news, automatic updates will be functional again for updates after 179. Bad news, due to a change in implementation of the automatic updates this brings an end to .Net 4.0 support. Chummer will no longer launch without .Net 4.5 or higher installed on your system.
- Rewrote crash handling. Now dumps most/all internal state, making debugging easier.
- Built-in weapon accessories are automatically assigned to the Internal accessory slot by default. If a weapon accessory should take up a slot naturally, just add a <mount> value to the accessory. This change only affects newly created/purchased weapons, so any existing weapons will need to be altered manually or deleted and re-added. Fixes #566.
- Ammunition can now add and replace the fire modes of weapons, using the firemode and firemodereplace nodes of weaponbonus. This change only takes effect during career mode, and is currently used exclusively for the Taurus Omni-6's heavy ammo type. Fixes #577.
- Fixed a crash issue caused by changing priority selection in Sum to Ten mode. Fixes #572.
- Qualities can have their Limit assigned as either 'no' or a numeric value. This is intended as something of a placeholder until proper levels for qualities are implemented at a later date.
- Support for AI characters added. Xeno/Protosapients and E-Ghosts are treated as Metavariants.
- Weapon Accessories can now modify the AP, Damage and FireMode of weapons using the damage, damagereplace, damagetype, ap, apreplace, firemode and firemodereplace keys. Currently this is used exclusively for the Overclocked mod (Okay technically it's currently an accessory, but there's no practical difference between the two at the moment so it goes where I say it goes.) Fixes #472
- Handling for vehicles has been split up into normal and offroad handling. The implementation method should prevent any issues from cropping up, but I've eaten my hat on that before.
- Calendar entries can now be removed. Fixes #552.
- The optional rule to have Essence Loss only reduce RES/MAG maximums has been re-enabled. Fixes #596.
- Each spare clip added to a weapon now tracks ammo individually rather than the previous hard-coded limit of four active slots. As a result of this change, Spare Clips no longer have the ability to directly store ammunition as a child item; they will be updated to display their currently loaded ammunition as an Extra value shortly.
- New key node for Weapon Accessories: ammoslot. ammoslot is an integer that adds the associated number of 'spare clip' items to the parent weapon. In most cases this will be 1 (Spare Clip, Speed Loader, etc.), but someone will probably come up with banana magazines that count as two mags or something eventually. Future proofing!
- Qualities can now add natural weapons directly using the naturalweapons node. Mostly this is for the infected, because "Bite (Infected) 2" offends me.
- Fixed a string formatting issue that prevented Accuracy modifications from adept powers from working properly for translated Chummer.
- Fixed an issue that prevented priority/sum-to-ten from using the gameplay options for their nuyen limit.
- Sum to Ten and Priority now use the same form for character generation. Doesn't mean anything particularly interesting for you guys, but may reduce or introduce some interesting new bugs.
- Contacts can now be dragged around and reordered according to your whims. It's only really easy to do when the control you want to move is expanded.
- Armor can now have a Rating; currently this is used exclusively for the cloaks from Hard Targets.
- Fixed the percentage discount for basic lifestyles.
- Fixed a translation issue for licences.
- Fixed a translation issue for basic lifestyles. Fixes #608.
- Armor improvements can now use Precedence attributes; this means that we can prevent a group of armour improvements from stacking with each other. Currently this is used for a small selection of skin-related qualities and biowares. See the Data Changes for more details. Fixes #602.
- Fixed an issue with advanced lifestyles that created zombie qualities. Fun for the vodoun and shedim, everyone else not so much. Fixes #583.
- Fixed an issue that prevented infected from moving to career mode.
- Added a tooltip for the Movement label in the Other Info tab to show the calculated movement speed in meters per combat turn or Kilometres per Hour. Implements #574.
- Note tooltips now have a maximum with of 100 pixels. Prevents the tooltips for contact descriptions and such from running across the whole screen. There's a good chance I missed one or two, so let me know if you see any. Fixes #581.
- Fixed an issue relating to the Improved Ability power causing other powers to revert to 0 ranks. Fixes #488, fixes #436, fixes #378.
- Fixed an issue with Improved Ability and exotic weapon skills not working together. Fixes #492.
- Fixed adept powers to stack properly with free levels from qi foci and mentor spirits. May break in interesting ways. Should fix #615.
- Matrix initiative can now benefit from the MatrixIniaitivePass improvement. Fixes #618.
- Added support for FixedValues for vehicle mods. Fixes #622.
- Exotic Weapon skills without any karma spent on them can now be removed once you've entered career mode.
- Exotic Weapon skills can now properly have their karma costs refunded in career mode.
- Exotic Weapon skills can't change their specialisation dynamically anymore once you're in career mode, because it breaks the karma refund. This is intentional and is unlikely to be changed unless you can present me with better-implemented code or a reason it shouldn't be like it is.
- Skill specializations will now save their value as the English string if possible rather than whatever the user enters; this should fix #595. Note that this fix is PROBABLY not retroactive.
- Fixed some issues with lifestyle qualities not saving properly if they contained an extra value. Fixes #623.
- Active Hardwires now implemented according to the rules, fixes #617. They're effectively similar to skillwires, but you select the affected skill at the time of purchase. They're currently mutually exclusive, so you can't have skillwires and hardwires affecting the same skill. As with skillwires, the character's actual rating and their hardwire rating don't stack.
- Fixed an issue that prevented accessories that came with a weapon from being flagged as Internal.
- Fixed some calculation issues for priority metatypes not showing the correct karma value when changing from a metavariant to a base metatype. Fixes #537.
- Fixed a crash with metavariants in Priority/Sum to Ten. Fixes #647.
- Fixed a crash caused by weapon accessories that have a cost based on rating. Fixes #650, fixes #656.
- Added spell Defense calculations in a tab on the right side of the career and creation windows. Closes #573.
- Changed the Improved Potential powers to use the limit modifier bonus instead of selectlimit; makes it a bit neater.
- Did some stuff to enable selecting multiple powers through the selectpower bonus node. This shouldn't affect any existing characters, but if you're using the Chaos Mentor Spirit I'd recommend deleting it and removing it. This miiiiight also break existing characters with Qi Foci. Probably not though. Like 70/30 at most.
- Did various shenanigans with the karma selection form to make it show qualities and karma costs properly.
- Rebuilt the functionality for Black Market Pipeline nad the Dealer Connection quality. Both should now work properly; there's a teeny tiny chance that existing characters that have the qualities might break, please raise a ticket if so.
- Fixed a crash caused by adding Genemods to a character with the Burnout's Way. Fixes #674.
- Fixed a UI issue that left the dropdown null when switching between genemods and bioware. Fixes #674.
- Enabled Vehicle Modifications to gain flat increases to Speed,Handling or Acceleration based on the Rating of the mod. Partial fix for #675.
- Fixed a visual bug with Limit Modifiers in creation mode. Fixes #665.
- Expanded the category selection mechanism to support falling back to default values. The general idea is that for each priority category loaded, it will attempt to load nodes that have a gameplayoptions node. If it can't do that, it'll load the Standard settings instead. This is intended to support alternate gameplay options as requested by #357. The actual data will need to be added for the appropriate categories, which I really can't be bothered transcribing.
- New Feature: Weapon Mounts will now limit the available weapons based on a predefined list of weapon categories. This also enables the weapon mounts added in Rigger 5.0 for adding weapons. I'm not particularly happy with how this looks in the XML so the underlying code might get changed over time. For now it's all good though.
- Fixed an issue that prevented magic- or reseonance-enabled karma-created characters from moving to Career mode.
- New Feature: Added a bunch of prompts to warn the user if they still have free contact points, knowledge points, skill points and such before moving to Career mode.
- Fixed an issue that caused a crash when adding armour to vehicles and drones.
- Partially implemented the Overclocker feature for Career mode. Code works, but I haven't added it on for Vehicles yet. Fixes #198.
- Added support for CTRL-A in the Notes forms. Slim chance I've missed other multiline forms Fixes #693.
- Fixed a crash caused by loading custom Critters related to movement strings.
- Fixed the display of Locations created by cybewrware or weapons with AllowGear properties. Fixes #536.
- Added some support for creating an Ally Spirit, per #244. Not 100% RAW yet, but it doesn't crash so that's a start.
- Added support for enabling calculated Public Awareness, per the rules from SR4. Hides the tooltips and calculations if not in use.
- Fixed the creation method for custom packs kits to not treat included mods as being purchased. Should fix #707 and fix #691.
- Save files is now in UTF-8 instead of UTF-16. This should not have any visible impact but it is more tool frindly and leads to smaller files
- Fixed an issue where qualities that add other qualities for free didn't discount properly. Fixes #762.
- Fixed an issue where default build methods other than Karma would cause a crash while launching the Options menu. Fixes #796.
- Fixed an issue with the Acceleration Enhancement modification causing a crash when printing. Fixes #772.
- Fixed an occasional issue in the Options menu where a null default character sheet caused a crash. Fixes #774.
- Added house rules to gain free contacts and knowledge skills based on the total value of your CHA or LOG+INT. Fixes #783.
- Fixed a bonus point calculation issue for YNT Softweave and Cloaks.
- Fixed a crash issue related to the Overclocker quality in career mode.
- Fixed a loading issue for commlinks with armor capacity values.
- Fixed an issue where removing a Foci before unbonding it would leave the Improvement enabled. Fixes #660. Note: Characters that have already been affected by this bug will need to manually remove the improvement.
- Fixed the ability to switch between adepts, magicians or technomancers when changing priority selections. Fixes #745.
- Added a method for grouping armour value improvements with the 'group' attribute. Fixes #758.
- Fixed an issue that prevented some old characters from being saved. Fixes #806.
- Added and consolidated some code to update initiation costs and discounts properly. Fixes #810.
- Implemented a minor quality of life update; the most recently used folder location is not stored for mugshots, per character. Fixes #458.
- Contacts, spirits and pets can now be linked to non-Chummer files; when clicking on the Open Character Sheet button, the file will be opened in the default application for that extension. Fixes #636.
- Prime runners now get twice the amount of free contacts compared to standard
- Essence Hole value is not impacted by grade or ware essence cost reductions. You don't get a little essence back each time now. Fixes #673
- "Test Subject" and "Factory Child Worker" life modules now give bonus nuyen. Fixes #811
- Fixed a crash caused when saving characters without mugshots.
- Fixed an incorrect value for binding spirit services. Fixes #827.
- Fixed karma costs for the Inspired quality from Sail Away, Sweet Sister in karmagen. Fixes #828.
- Added a close icon for the Options window, allows you to cancel out of saving any changes you make. Should fix #700.
- Chummer now correctly uses the "Characters don't gain Karma after Quality Limit" option in Karma and Life Module mode.

Build 178:
Application Change:
- Fixed a calculation issue for the Edge attribute when using Sum-To-Ten or Priority.
- Fixed a crash issue caused when adding commlinks and cyberdecks.
- Standard Knowledge Skills are suffixed with the Category they're a part of. There's a minor issue that preserves the skill name until the character is next loaded that will be fixed later.
- Clicking Add Again on the Spell Selection menu will preserve the currently opened spell categories. This is more or less just a proof of concept and will be expanded to other forms in later patches.

Build 177:
Application Change:
- Fixed a crash when selecting positive lifestyle qualities.
- Life Module backstories are now generated by a button press on the Character Info page.
- Print Preview mode is accessible from a context menu in the Character Print Viewer.
- Vehicles, Cyberware and Drones now have a Matrix Condition Monitor tracker. Note; the cyberware CM is effectively limited to 'root' devices, as in cyberlimbs, Wired Reflexes, things you wouldn't normally expect to be attached to other things. While I can fiddle with this setting easily enough, a bit of internal testing just left my testers confused as to whether they were bricking the parent device or not. Looking for feedback on this.
- Refactored a chunk of the Improvements code to use the new Log formatting. Mostly just stops it from throwing warnings at me during builds, but is a bit more human-readable.
- Fixed a bug that stopped lifestyle qualities from loading properly when edited.
- Fixed an incorrectly calculated Drain value.
- The Create Natural Weapon form can now select STR in addition to the current STR/2 option.

- Fixed some issues with genemods being able to benefit from cyber/bioware grades.
- Gear and Cyberware can now use the variable value Parent Cost in a similar manner to Weapon Cost for weapon accessories. Currently this is used exclusively for the Implant Medic Hard Nanoware.
- Concealability modifiers for Gear can now be based on Rating. Currently used for the Extended Clip modifier.
- Fixed a calculation issue for lifestyle qualities.
- Fixed some issues that cropped up for 'ware that adds qualities (Daredrenaline, Metatype Reduction, etc.)
- Implemented support for selecting the slot that a weapon modiciation occupies. May break in interesting ways, but should allow holdouts and such to attach spare clips again.
- Commlinks and cyberdecks can now switch their ASDF attributes around. This capability will be properly segregated out into Cyberdecks in a later patch.
- Previous Priority selections are preserved when you use the Change Priority Selection button in Create Mode. Fixes #497.

- Renamed the Magic Sense metagenetic quality to prevent it from clashing with the metatype quality.

- Hard Nanoware from Chrome Flesh has been added. Because of the way it interacts with cyberware, the Implant Medic is listed as a piece of cyberware.
- Altered the way Weapon Accessories are handled to enable pre-configured Ratings. Custom-made weapons with built-in accessories will need to have their format changed to <accessories><accessory<name>Whatever</name></accessory></accessories>. Existing characters should load properly; please contact me if you run into any issues with this.
- Fixed a crash caused by the Extended Clip.
- Added Nanoware from Chrome Flesh.
- Proper bonuses added for most of the genetech from Chrome Flesh. Myostatin Inhibitor still doesn't have the karma discount, because it's tedious to implement.
- Fixed the minimum INT for Wakyambi to 2.
- Holdouts have had the <allowaccessory> tag set to true as a result of code changes to how accessories can be attached to a weapon. May not take effect on existing weapons; if not, remove and re-add the weapon.
- Renamed the description for the Cat Mentor to not refer to Infiltration.
- Removed the Sail Away, Sweet Sister version of the Personalised Grip, as it's replaced by the Hard Targets version.

New String:
- Menu_FilePrintPreview

Renamed String:
- String_OverContactPoints renamed to String_OverPriorityPoints

Build 176:
Application Change:
- Gauss Ammo is now considered ammo for heavy weapons instead of normal guns.
- Free contacts don't violate the (C+L)>7 limit when creating a character. This allows prime dataheaven membership to pass inspection...
- Changed the default value for maritial art techniques to cost 5 instead or 4 karma, to conform with official rules. For older instalations, delete the settings file or change this in options.
- When selecting life modules that brings an attribute above chargen limit, chummer don't crash anymore.
- Reflex recorder now properbly affects skills linked to a physical attribute instead of the physical skill group.
- Redliner and Cyber Singularity Seeker now grant the proper bonuses.
- Fixed a crash caused by double-clicking Spell Categories.

- Fixed an issue that stopped rulebook selections from saving properly.
- Fixed an issue in Life Modules if trying to add more than one Real Life Module.
- Prototype Transhuman works. Personal new metric: if I get more than twenty requests for a quality to be implemented within a month of the book coming out, that quality is broken.
- Made some changes to the calculation method for a character's Metagenetic Limit. Fixes an issue with the changeling limit being set incorrectly to 0 or making certain metagenetic qualities flag as standard.
- Weapon Accessories can have Ratings. Currently for things like Ceramic Components that have multiple levels.
- Fixed an issue with Weapon Costs caused by Ceramic Components.
- Fixed an error caused by Life Modules trying to give you attribute points over your metatype limit.
- Qualities that are not yet implemented in code will now have an <implemented>no</implemented> key that highlights them in red.
- New improvement node type: <selectimprovements>. This allows us to perform the selectattribute improvement more than once for a particular quality. This is mostly used for the Infected pseudo-quality.
- Fixed the method for generating Advanced Lifestyle LP.

Data Change:
- Poor Self Control (Attention Seeking, Sadistic) now properly grant karma.
- First-pass addition of Hard Targets content has been added. Big thanks to Reddit's /u/Fweeba and HaikenEdge.
    Some provisional issues:
    - Adept Spell does not work properly.
    - There are a few items that use Ratings in ways that haven't previously been required (Ie, the cloaks), so they're not as clean as I'd otherwise like.
- Ares Thuderstruck Gauss Rifle renamed to Ares Thunderstruck Gauss Rifle.
- The Fame qualities provide the associated Public Awareness increases.
- Added prompts for sides (Left, Right) for most cyberware that could reasonably be expected to need it.
- The Improved Potential power has been split up into three different powers, due to the way it works. Characters that have the existing power should work fine.
- Bioware Limbs from Chrome Flesh added.
- Additional Life Modules added. Most Life Modules now have a random story attached. The bulk of these stories are jokes, because it's good to laugh. Note: Checking and unchecking the Automatic Backstory checkbox on the Character Info page will select new random values, if they're present.
- Removed the Extravagant Eyes metagenetic quality.
- Fixed Karma values for the Cyclops Eye, Vestigial Tail and Feathers metagenetic qualities.
- The Extended Masking Metamagic has been enabled as a power Adepts can take, as it's functionally identical to the Improved Masking power.
- Added the Body Sculpt power from Bloody Business.
- Fixed a crash caused by lifestyles with qualities.
- Fixed a crash when selecting the drug Snuff.

Build 175:
Application Change:
- Removed extraneous code for the Infirm quality.
- Minor quality of life update; if you have no Settings file present when creating a new character, Chummer will prompt you to launch the Options menu.
- You can now press Ctrl-W to close a character file.
- Fixed an issue with purchasing additional months of a lifestyle in career mode.
- Fixed an issue with lifestyle qualities that had the selecttext bonus.
- The Quality selector will show negative metagenetic qualities by default, but hide positive ones unless you're a Changeling.
- Support for the Trust Fund quality added.
- The Technomancer registered sprite limit is now based on LOG instead of CHA.
- Fixed an issue with the cyberware selection screen not showing Essence costs.
- Complex Forms show their translated name properly.
- Redid how basic lifestyles work. Should make them behave better, should prevent crashes for older characters.
- Fixed an issue that caused initiation schooling to show as a nuyen gain in the karma/nuyen log.

Data Change:
- Nanohive crash issue fixed.
- Ratings for the Expanded Volume and Amplified Immune System bioware fixed to 4.
- Fixed incorrect category for certain rituals.
- Missing drugs from Chrome Flesh added. Custom drugs aren't implemented yet. As an interim, you can use Custom Item to emulate the drugs.
- Fixed incorrect data for the Nitama Sporter.

String Changes:
- Message_CharacterOptions_OpenOptions
- MessageTitle_CharacterOptions_OpenOptions

Build 174:
Application Change:
- Calculation of Essence discounts is now multiplicative instead of additive. I am assured this is a good thing.
- Fixed the default values for free karma knowledge. If you have an existing settings file, please reset to defaults by clicking Tools > Options > Karma Costs > Reset to Default.
- Issues with Sum to Ten character generation artifically granting a MAG value higher than the metatype maximum should be fixed. I expect it'll break again in a week or so somehow, so please let me know if you experience any issues.
- Chummer's main window now shows the current version in the title to aid troubleshooting.
- Fixed a crash issue with Dwarves and the Resistance to Pathogens/Toxins metaquality, courtesy of Argo2445.
- Fixed a crash caused by missing information in SURGE qualities.
- Fixed a crash when trying to add items that include the selecttext bonus to vehicles.
- Public Awareness is no longer an automatically calculated value.
- Positive Metagenetic Qualities are hidden by default UNLESS you have one of the Changeling qualities, or disable the 'hide qualities I can't take' checkbox. Not particularly happy with the implementation for this; feedback appreciated.

Data Change:
- Magical Education Life Module now has a proper karma cost; prevents crashes.
- Myostatin Inhibitor genemod now adds 1 Strength. The karma cost needs additional code support and hasn't been implemented properly yet.
- Fixed skill usage for cyber implant weapons.
- Fixed missing categories for the Attention-Seeking and Sadistic variants of Poor Self Control.
- Fixed an issue with the Net weapon that caused a crash.
- Fixed a crash issue with the Trauma Damper, courtesy of SolitarySky.
- Changed the Priority B Elf's Special points to 6.

Translation Changes:
- Added French translations courtesy of sethsatan.

Build 173:
Application Change:
- Dumpshock link changed to issue tracker.
- A First-pass effort at adding a filter for Missions-restricted items has been added to the Options menu. Will be getting a later review to enable better filtering of the qualities, but for now it's just a global option.
- Fixed a bug with life modules where Tír Tairngire wouldn't show demographics.
- Chummer now handles essence holes automatically. Old items may need to be re-added.
- College Education/School of Hard Knocks/Linguist and Jack of All Trades work properly for knowledge skills during character creation. Again.
- Most of the functionality for Infected has been implemented. Todo: Fix up the free attribute gain to not use qualities because it's ugly, and put in the data files content.
- N of M contact points in priority build works again.
- Fixed an issue where chummer failed to open when clicking on a .chum5 file.
- Implemented functionality for the quality "Friends in High Places".
- Save/Load methods for Advanced Lifestyles should actually work properly now, but it's still a bit fragile. Bugs are to be expected, particularly if you change your mind a lot.
- Most issues with adepts getting levels of powers from multiple sources should be resolved. (Mentor Spirits, Foci, etc.)
- Rounding issue for Recoil Compensation from Strength resolved.
- Variable costs for Qualities enabled to support the Rank quality. May eventually lead into redoing the way Qualities with multiple ratings work, because High Pain Tolerance (Rating 6) offends me every time I scroll past it.

Data Change:
- Organising data file contents into regions to keep things easy to work with.
- Rank Quality added.
- The Debug Lifestyle has been hidden.
- Lifemodules no longer contains a "Magical Education (Archetype)".
- Tír is now spelled correctly a few more places.
- Equipment, Weapon and Ammo PACKs from run faster added.
    There are a couple of important caveats with this:
    First, we generally haven't bothered to input PACKs that are a single item. If someone would like to write them up then that's fine, but there's only so many hours of data entry one can do.
    Second, items that don't currently exist haven't been added in, like backpacks. Again, mostly a tedium thing but the PACKs code doesn't play nice with Custom Item and I don't like littering up the data files with fluff items.
      Items not added include:
      - Backpack.
      - Sound-link on the earbuds.
      - Disposable inhaler from Cheap Soldier Pack.
      - Orange vest from Sportsman Pack.
      - Reusable Syringe from Tranq Darter Pack and Tranq Pistol Darter Pack.
      - Bug-out bag's dufflebag.
      - Mechanic Shop's duct-tape.
      - Surveillance pack's Periscope.
      - Infiltration Kit contains a Micro-Transceiver on the assumption that that's the correct item.
      - Medium Machine gunner pack doesn't contain ammo belts, but does come with the ammo.
  - Ammo packs not added as stacks split among multiple types of weapons is not possible in Chummer5a.
  - Rigger Pack gets Reaction Enhancers instead of the mythical reflex enhancers. Come on guys, it's a list of items. Seriously, if you need an editor I'm sure there's tons of people who'd be happy to sign an NDA.
  - Big Boom Pistoleer pack has 190 rounds of heavy regular amunition, because Chummer doesn't care about your brass.
  - Most lifestyles ignored, per the 'we can't be bothered adding single items' policy mentioned above.
  - Gunbunny pack not added as it contains unattached accessories, which Chummer doesn't currently like handling. To be added in a future patch.
  - Some custom packs added from reddit's shadowrun comunitieswith permission from /u/NotB0b and ShadowNET SysOp.
  - Fixed an issue with the Extreme Cyberimplant and Junkyard Jaw from Chrome Flesh.
  - Pulse Weave costs Rating * 3000.

New strings:
- Message_HighContact

Build 172:
Application Change:
- Due to the return of Move-By-Wire, Initiative is no longer capped to your REA+INT's augmented maximum.
- Fixed an issue with lifestyle quality costs that caused a crash on print.
- The cap for Qualities is now based on your Gameplay Option. For example, a Prime Runner can spend up to 35 Karma on Positive qualities, and gain 35 from Negative qualities.
- Compability mode added. Chummer should now **run** on .NET 4.0, but some stuff might not work, and we (the Chummer5a team) won't provide support.
- Fixed a bug where advanced (and normal?) lifestyles would crash on other languages
- More specific spirit data is available for charsheets to use.
- Chummer now has a crash reporter. If Chummer encounters an error it can't recover from, it will (if given permision) send a data package (hopefully) identifying the source of the crash.
- Chummer now won't pretend you have 25 BP in SumToTen/Priority build modes
- Fixed edge case where Sum To Ten would ask for a karma amount like Karma/Life Module builds
- Prime Data Haven now automatically creates/removes an appropriate 5C/3L contact.
- Cyberware can now add qualities. Not particularly happy with the implementation, but it works.
- Cyberware can have a metatype restriction.
- Born Rich quality works properly.
- The Select Bioware/Cyberware form can now display a special notes text field to indicate weird workaroundy stuff that I can't be bothered fixing with code.
    - For example, Striking Calluses are treated as a Rating item, with the Notes field explaining why. Currently has no support for translations.
- Essence Discount house rule enabled. Can be used to emulate the Prototype Transhuman quality for you munchkin mages that need your pain editors and whatnot until I get around to implementing it properly.
- Fixed an issue with the incorrect cap being used for spell selection. There's still a couple of UI failures that need to be resolved, but they're a relatively low priority.

Data Change:
- The Water Sprite quality confers +2 to Diving and Swimming, instead of prompting you to select one of them.
- Machine Pistols were missing a few accessory slots; they can now mount stocks and such.
- Cyberware Holdout Pistol typo fixed.
- Gameplay Options have been moved into their own XML file, gameplayoptions.xml.
- Added the missing qualities "Poor Self Control (Sadistic)" and "Poor Self Control (Attention-Seeking)"
- Lifestyles.xml GUIDs populated to support the language fix.
- Adapsin bioware properly discounts cyberware costs.
- Fire Modes for the Colt Inception have been fixed.
- Metatype Reduction has been added. Due to the differing benefits, it is split up into two different items for Orks and Trolls, respectively.
- Troll Reduction has been added.
- Assorted bits of cosmetic bioware and bio-weapons from Chrome Flesh have been added.
- Life Modules have been added from all existing source books, courtesy of joha4270 and angelforest. Functionality is complete-ish, but there are some awkward modules in Further Education and such that may not quite work as expected. Feedback and suggestions for this is greatly appreciated.
- Fixed an issue that stopped Aspected Magicians from gaining access to the Spells and Spirits tab. Replace-all is nobody's friend.

String Changes:
Altered:
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedNegativeQualitiesLimit
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedPositiveQualities
- Checkbox_Options_ExceedNegativeQualities
- Message_SpellLimit

New:

Build 171:
Application Change:
- Fixed an issue with Priority characters not loading properly. Malformed XML file.

Data Change:
- Accuracy for the Cougar Fine Blades altered.
- Chakram weapon added.
- The PPSK-4 has had a Collapsed Frame accessory added to it that confers -6 Concealability to represent the collapsible box thing you can put it in. Accessory mods can also no longer be installed on the gun.
- Blowgun range changed.
- Sound suppressor added to the Barret.
- Missing Ammo from Run and Gun added.
- Skilljacks and Skillwires have had their costs adjusted to match Chrome Flesh values, because apparently errata isn't a thing that's done these days.
- Wireless Skillsoft Networks have been added as Lifestyle Qualities. Yes, Advanced Lifestyles are still a little broken. It's on the list.

IMPORTANT NOTE:.NET 4.5.1 IS CURRENTLY A REQUIRED COMPONENT. CHUMMER WILL CRASH ON VERSIONS BELOW 4.5.1.

Build 170:
Application Change:
- Metasapient cost is properly counted in Sum to Ten and Priority.
- Fixed an issue with the default Free Contact Multiplier value. Existing installations may still have a Contact Multiplier value of 1. To fix this, open Tools > Options > House Rules and enable/disable the "Free Contact Points equal to Charisma times X" rule.
- Fixed an issue with the Critical Strike power that caused a crash, due to the name being changed.
- Jack of All Trades shows the proper tooltip value.
- Variable Sum to X character creation enabled. Changing Build Methods still doesn't work quite right, so it's recommended to make a new character if you want to do this.
- Genemods and Symbionts are locked to Standard grade properly.
- Internal changes to how some values are stored. Shouldn't affect characters.
- Added support for building characters with Life Modules.
    | If a character has multiple knowledge skills with the same name, they can optionally be folded in to one another by clicking the Collapse button on the right side of the skill.
    | Only debug life modules have been created thus far; any assistance in writing up the data for this would be greatly appreciated.
    | Selecting Life Modules will pre-generate a Background for your character. This can still be edited normally, but makes for a useful springboard. Development is still in the early stages, but is more or less functional. Full thanks to joha4270 for implementing this.

Data Change:
- Priviliged Family Name's SIN requirement changed to National or Corporate, rather than Corporate (Limited).
- Ambidextrous quality is now enabled for multiple limbs. Shine on, you crazy Indian diamonds.
- Dragonslayer Mentor Spirit fixed to give +2 to Combat Spells instead of Detection.
- Fixed a missing value for the Linguist property that was preventing its bonus from working.
- Casemods can be removed from Cyberware.
- Living Focus and Keratin Control have been added to the Street Grimoire book. The Shadowrun Forum Post 1 book has been removed.

Build 169:
Application Change:

- Content for Chrome Flesh added. Data provided courtesy of Fweeba.

Build 168:
Application Change:
- Did some stuff to make spell descriptors show up in character sheets.

- Fixed an issue with skills changing their values incorrectly.
- Fixed an issue with discounts for knowledge skills not working properly.

Data Change:
- Fixed a fault with the calculation of Net ranges that caused a crash.
- Data Trails content added. Some additional functionality for commlink dongles and such is still required, so they haven't been included yet. Much thanks to Iridios for his work with this.

Build 167:
New collaborator on the project acquired! joha4270 has been assisting with a variety of issues, and is currently tackling the implementation of Life Modules, along with several other tricky problems. Huzzah!

Application Change:
- Changes made to the Contact controls; most features of a contact are now only visible on hover. Makes things a bit neater. Looking for feedback on implementation of this. Good? Not good?
- Support for free contacts enabled.
- Support for group contacts from Run Faster implemented.
- Support for the Made Man quality from Run Faster implemented.
- Karma and Nuyen graphs now scale with time.
- Fixed a bug with calculation of Street Cred.

- Fixed an issue in which the Maximum Modified Rating rule could not be disabled.
- Fixed issues with Limit Enhancements not saving.
- Technical School, College Education, Linguist qualities do the discounty things they're supposed to.
- Fixed issues with the optional rule to re-group skill groups if the skills were balanced when the character was saved.
- Fixed an embarassing issue with broken skill groups levelling themselves back down to the grouped rating.
- Fixed the behaviour of Custom Fit so that it only counts if the Custom Fitted item is also equipped. Not super happy with the code, but I'm also tired of looking at it, so eh.
- Undocumented inherited feature of the day: the <armoroverride> key supports Custom Fit. If an item with the Custom Fit (Stack) mod is equipped, and has an Extra value that matches another equipped piece of armour, the armour value of the item will be changed to the override value.
- Character creation validation now checks for Betaware/Deltaware and stops you from having nice things.
- Firemodes now work properly for languages other than English. (Original code didn't expect that someone would actually change the string for the firemode abbreviations, so kudos to you, random German guy who translated everything!)
- Made some alterations to the appearance and function of contacts. Outstanding issues: Made Man and karma costs don't update properly.

Data Change:
- Fixed a big with Colt Agent Special not using Heavy Pistol ammunition.
- Fixed incorrect calculation for varieties of Indomitable.
- Hanuman name fixed again. Frankly CGL should take the initiative of spelling the name correctly, for I am incapable of spelling errors.
- Enhanced Articulation no longer prompts for the skill bonus.
- Keen-eared and Balance Receptor are properly marked as Metagenetic qualities.
- Digital Doppelganger now prompts for a text entry, and requires that you be a SINner.

- Fixed an issue with Spirit Bane being available to non-magic users.
- Fixed an issue that enabled the free knowledge skills for point buy if the free contact point house rule was enabled.

Build 165
Application Change:
- Knowledge skills actually fixed now. Is now completely buildmethod-agnostic, so won't break when you look at it funny.

Data Change:
- Fixed an issue with Hanuman in Sum-to-Ten/Priority.

Build 164
Application Change:

- Fixed an issue in which point-buy characters weren't having points removed after patch 162.
- Fixed an issue with characters that had Middle/Medium lifestyles causing a crash.
- Fixed a number of stupid errors with knowledge skill and contact calculation. Knowledge skills still need an errata to confirm whether/how they're supposed to interact with karma and free points in point buym but should otherwise work correctly.
- House rules enabled to provide for a different contact and knowledge skill multiplier.
- House rules to override quality limits without otherwise breaking chargen rules enabled.

Data Change:

Build 163
Administrative Change:
- Controls (Skills, groups, etc.) moved into a separate folder because I'm tired of looking for them and can't be bothered prefixing. Organisation is love. Organisation is life.

Application Change:
- AUTOMATIC UPDATES ENABLED. Now I just have to not forget to update the version metadata every time I fiddle with something...
    - To use automatic updates, open the Tools window and click on Check For Updates. Any new file versions should be available for download. Select the files, hit the download button and cross your fingers.
- Fix for Friends in High Places causing a crash due to invalid bounds.
- Fixed an issue with free karma knowledge reverting values to 0.
- Rewrite of Knowledge Skill BP calculation to support free points. Needs some logic validation.

- Added functionality for the College Education quality from Run Faster.

Data Change:
- Updated some spells with correct ranges, from the errata.
- Updated some martial arts, courtesy of Urs Zeidler.

Build 162
Application Change:
- Points for free Contacts include Karma values.
- Amended an issue where the first point of Connection or Loyalty was free for Contacts. Basing this off the example text on page 99, but I'm moderately sure that there was a falling out between the development team and the writers at some point, so they may not have been talking at that point.
- Added an optional rule to generate free contacts during Point Buy. Currently working on adding free contact points during Point Buy. Shouldn't be much longer to complete.
- Refixed an issue with skill groups adding points to the Priority number counters.  Will also clean up karmagen characters that were built accidentally using Points instead of just Karma.
- Fixed issues with the Uneducated, Infirm, and Uncouth qualities during chargen. (Additional karma costs, wrong karma costs, just generally broken.)
- Support added for the School of Hard Knocks quality.

Data Change:
- Blind (Mage) quality is now available for Adepts that have the Astral Perception quality.

- String_OverContactPoints

Build 161 (Reverting things that weren't broken Hotfix)
Application Change:
- So it turns out that the default options don't actually populate from where they're defined, but are an entirely separate int. Todo: buy scotch. Try not to cry. Cry deeply.
- Fixed the issue with skills doubling their rating on load. Commenting out code without explaining why you did it is dangerous, kiddies. Don't uncomment things you don't know the purpose of.

Build 160
Application Change:
- When using Point Buy, karma can no longer be carried over into Career Mode, because Point Buy cannot have nice things.
- Sum to Ten now validates over/under limits.
- Nuyen cost for Martial Arts and styles removed, because I'm an idiot and didn't pay attention to what Instruction Cost meant.
- Revalidated default karma options again, default value for contacts changed.
- Added a prompt to close open characters when changing Options. Will look at this again properly later to support saving the characters and reloading them, but for now it just closes, prompting the user to save any modified characters.
- Did some fiddling with the UI for Point Buy and the optional 'Free Knowledge Skills like Priority' rule. Buy With Karma is enabled by default, etc.
- Removing Rituals should no longer cause terrible crashes in chargen mode.
- Complex Forms limited to the correct amounts during Chargen and Career mode.
- Drone Condition Monitor assigned to correct value, courtesy of BodieSullivan.

New Strings:

- Base Recoil Compensation increased to 1. Recoil granted by Strength reduced to STR/3.
- Default state of the rule "Allow broken skillgroups to be regrouped if they have an equal value." changed to enabled.
- Improvements generated by Foci binding (Improved Physical Attribute, for example) are now removed when a Focus is unbound. Should fix edge cases that were effected in a similar manner.
- Negative Metavariant karma points count towards the Negative Quality limit. (Ie, a priority C hobgoblin can only take 20 Karma worth of Negative Qualities.)
- Limited support for using web-browsers (Chrome, Firefox) as your PDF application added. IE doesn't work, and I'm not interested in figuring out why.
- Power Point limits are re-calculated when Karma values are changed.
- Essence Loss during Karmagen correctly pulls from Karma.
- PACKs validated for functionality. They should work, but TERRIBLE HORRIBLE CRASHES WILL HAPPEN IF A PACK INCLUDES AN ITEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. The default set of PACKs will be created in the near future.
- Advanced Lifestyles are enabled in creation mode. Basic lifestyles have currently been disabled, because I am lazy and haven't remade it. I've only done limited testing with this, so please report any issues that you come across.

Data Change:
- Concealed Quick-Draw Holster: Concealment value set to -1.
- Custom Ballistic Mask: Social Limit increased to 2.
- Uniform (Disguise) crash fixed.

Data Change:
- Technomancer, Adept, Mystic Adept, Magician, Aspected Magician and Changeling qualities no longer contribute towards quality limit during karmagen.
- SURGE qualities all tagged as metagenetic improvements to support the new way SURGE works. Also should have been done from the start, but that's neither here nor there.
- Colt New Model Revolver amended to use proper statistics.

Build 5.157

Data Change:
- Metavariant/Metasapient BP costs and karma values shifted into Priorities/SumtoTen.xml files because Hobgoblins are terrible.
- Ares HVAR book reference altered to proper book (Run and Gun)

Issues:
- Metavariants that confer bonus karma (Hobgoblin, Oni at Priority C) currently are not counted against the maximum limit for Negative Qualities.

Build 5.155
Application Change:

- Metasapients partially added. (They're in, but prices are largely incorrect)

Build 5.154
Application Change:
- Change Metatype/Priority Selection special menu fixed to remove and disable Special attributes if you no longer have the relevant Talent. Needs some extra things done later to clean it up, but it works.
- Fixed a Nuyen calculation issue that stopped starting nuyen from being included.
Data Change:
- Restored a fix to Elf metavariants that caused a crash.
- Settings.xml will no longer be published in builds, to prevent issues with debugging data.

- Removed needless, broken validation that stopped karma-nuyen conversion from working in priority/sum-to-ten builds.

Build 5.153.1

Build 5.149

Build 5.145

Build 5.144
Data changes:
- "Resistance to Pathogens and Toxins" renamed to "Resistance to Pathogens/Toxins" due to weird dwarf racism issue.

Administrative changes:
- frmMetatype renamed to frmKarmaMetatype for organisational purposes.

- Submersion fixed; Echoes are now purchasable.

Build 5.140
- Fixed the tooltip showing the karma values for raising magic in career mode.

Build 5.139
- Added in the ability to multi-specialize in skills post character creation.
- Updated Mnemonic Enhancer to provide its bonus to the Mental Limit and Memory Tests.
- Updated Tailored Pheromones to provide a flat bonus to the social limit instead of a limit modifier.
- Fixed a bug with Qi Foci that could prevent it from showing the power it provides in the bound foci list.

- Fixed the calculation of the Mortimer of London coats when dealing with unequipped armor.
- Updated Chem Seal and Environmental Adaptation for Full Body Armor to be mods for Full Body Armor rather than armors themselves.
- For the Translator: Fixed both the Page and Translated columns so that they correctly save changes.

Build 5.137 (beta)
- Before anything else, I want to thank Geg (chummer5de@gmail.com) for going above and beyond working on the German translation for Chummer. A very large part of Chummer's data files have been translated into German by Geg over the last week and I cannot thank him enough for taking it upon himself to do this.
- In order to resolve differences between the English and German printings, I've added a new book entitled "Shadowrun 5th Edition (German)".  I've attached to this book the German versions of the Raven Mentor Spirit and Skilljack Cyberware.  This should allow German players to use the versions printed in their books and other players to use them if their group is treating those rules as errata to the English book.
- Updated Contacts by splitting the Name field into three fields: Name, Location, and Archetype. The dropdown has been moved to Archetype. Any existing Contacts will show any existing info under Name.  The character sheets have been updated to show the new Contact fields.
- Updated the Ultimax Rain Forest Carbine to use the updated stats provided in the Missions FAQ Update version 1.1.1.
- Removed the Restrictive quality from SWAT Armor that was there in error.
- Fixed a bad tooltip for the Cyberlegs house rule.

- Fixed the Drain Resist dice pool for limited spells.
- Fixed the armor calculation for stacking armor including occasionally stacking items like the Mortimer's High-Fashion armor.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent adding the free adept powers granted by a mentor spirit if in Career mode.

Build 5.136 (beta)
- Due to popular request, Enemies are back again. These are not part of 5th Edition (at least not yet) so using them is a house rule.
- The Contacts/Enemies UI has been updated to use tabs rather than being stacked.  This gives a little more room for both contacts and enemies.
- Contacts now show a dropdown list for the name allowing you to enter your own contact information or select one from a list. As of yet, Enemies have no options in the list but this will be added at a later date (suggestions welcome).
- Added logging to the update function. Hopefully this will be helpful in tracking down issues when downloading updates.
- Removed a possible bug that could cause the update to go into a loop.
- Added a new Buy With Karma checkbox to each of the Active and Knowledge skills in Creation mode that allows you to buy the specialization with karma instead of skill points.
- Added tooltips to the house rules on the options dialog to help explain which each house rule does.
- Added a house rule to the Options dialog that will allow Initiation and Submersion during Create mode.
- As it was pointed out to me that I missed the sentence on page 66 that explicitly allows spending Attribute Points on the bonus point granted by Exceptional Attribute or Lucky, I've removed the house rules relating to Exceptional Attribute and am now following the rules as specified.  Sorry for any confusion.

Build 5.135 (beta)
- Minor fix to enable downloading the translator app via Chummer update.

Build 5.134 (beta)
- Now includes a translator application (Translator.exe).  This app allows you to create and edit the language files to translate Chummer into non-English languages.  If you're interested in doing a translation for distribution with Chummer, please let me know via srchummer5@gmail.com and we'll make arrangements for you to send me updated language files.  This is the first release of this translator app so please let me know if you run into problems using it. There's a bit more to come for handling translation, this was just the first big step.
- To resolve an issue with Exotic weapon skills, special weapons were moved into the appropriate Exotic weapon category.
- Fixed a bug that could cause Adept Power Points to be miscalculated in Career mode when adding cyber/bioware.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when printing your character.
- Removed the Enemies section as this was a leftover from 4th Edition.
- Removed the duplicate Narcoject entry.
- Added the low-light and infrared flashlights from the core book.

Build 5.133 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when adding adept powers.

Build 5.132 (beta)
- Added a House Rule "Use Skill Points on broken groups" that allows you to spend Active Skill Points in Creation mode on skills belonging to broken skill groups.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent raising Edge, Magic, or Resonance to maximum.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash if a skill group was raised which included a skill that had free levels.
- Fixed the page numbers for a handful of Illusion Spells.
- Removed a duplicate entry for Gamma-Scopolamine.
- Removed the button to add Adept Power Points in Career mode for Mystic Adepts.
- Fixed a bug that would erroneously charge a special attribute point when puchasing cyberware or bioware.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the range values for a number of thrown weapons from being shown.
- Fixed a bug causing new spirits added in Create mode being added by a Mystic Adept to have the wrong Force value.
- Fixed a spelling error on the Shadowrun Forum Post 1.
- Added Advanced Medkits from Bullets & Bandages.  No availability is listed for Advanced Medkits in B&B so I just used the availability for standard Medkits.
- Updated the validation warning message concerning having gear over capacity so that it now specifies exactly which items are over capacity.
- Fixed a bug that would throw up a validation error on characters using Prime Runner stats that have more than 25 karma in positive or negative qualities.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Prime Runners from converting to Career mode.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the character load to fail if it was a Prime Runner with more than 10 karma spent on nuyen.
- Updated the Missile Mastery Adept Power to include the +1DV and +1 Dice on Thrown Weapons.  Not sure this is the correct fix though as this is only supposed to apply to non-explosive thrown weapons.
- Fixed a bug allowing purchase of more levels than should be allowed on Flexibility, Stillness, and Penetrating Strike.  This fix will only apply on powers added after this update.
- Fixed a bug with the Ares Giantslayer Slingshot that was causing a crash when selecting it.

Build 5.131 (beta)
A quick shout out... I had programming help on this build from a friend of mine named Ed.  Thank you Ed!

- Completely rebuilt how karma is spent on Attributes, Special Attributes, Skill Groups, Active Skills, and Knowledge Skills to reflect the RAW on the steps in character creation. All existing characters should load up just fine but karma costs may have changed to reflect applying the RAW. Each of these now have separate entry boxes for applying points from your Priority selection and for buying up with Karma. Validation now checks to see if you've overspent on your points.  I believe I've been able to correctly handle the steps as written while giving a UI that allows you to treat it as a single step (rather than going through a gateway similar to "Mark as Created").  The only thing I haven't updated as part of this is whether skill specialization is paid for with skill points or karma... at this time it automatically uses skill points to pay for skill specialization but I'll update this in a future enhancement when I will also tackle being able to have multiple specializations per skill.  There are two new house rules to allow you to tailor how these rules are applied to some degree. If others are needed, send along a request and I'll take a look.
- Added custom Traditions. If you select the Custom Tradition from the dropdown, it will enable additional fields for you to provide your tradition name, select your drain attributes, and select your spirits for each school.  This information is saved with the character and is portable with it.
- Fixed the skill bonus from the Cat Mentor Spirit so that it will apply to Sneaking (the English core book says Infiltration on page 321).
- Spell dice pools should now pull from the correct skill (Spellcasting, Ritual Spellcasting, Alchemy, Artificing) for each spell.
- Corrected the drain value for the Resist Pain Spell.
- Fixed the values on the Build Summary tab for Spells, Complex Forms, and Contacts which under some conditions might show the wrong value.
- Fixed the Armor value on the Condition Monitor tab in Career Mode to show the correct value.
- Added the armor encumberance rule from page 169 so that it applies to armor accessories such as helmets and shields.
- Removed the duplicate Astral Powder gear entry.
- Fixed the missing availability and price for Fetishes.
- Clicking on a blank area within the Contacts, Skill Groups, Active Skills, or Knowledge Skills regions will allow you to scroll them with the scroll wheel.
- Removed the tooltips that were showing the wrong text on the labels on the Limits tab.
- Added a house rule to allow paying only the standard cost for Qualities in Career Mode instead of double as per RAW.
- Removed the option to buy a vehicle used as this was from 4th Edition and has not been carried over into 5th.

Build 5.130 (beta)
- Removed some duplicate specialties from the Politics Knowledge Skill.
- Made the Adept Way Qualities not available for non-adepts.
- Added the Astral Limit to the Limits tab and the character sheets.  Keep in mind that limit modifiers to either your mental limit or social limit that can apply in the astral might conditionally apply to your astral limit during play.
- Fixed Enhanced Articulation Bioware so that it applies the correct skill bonuses.
- Fixed several issues surrounding full Cyberlimbs. Attribute averaging has been removed as it was a 4th Edition rule. The limb on the character sheet now shows the limb's total Strength, Agility, and its Physical Limit.
- Movement rate now uses the augmented Agility value.
- Added an option under House Rules to use derived Attributes from Cyberlegs when calculating movement speed.
- Added all that lovely Qi Foci code from build 5.129 to Career Mode as well. Completely missed that one.
- Now correctly charges double for positive qualities added or negative qualities deleted after character creation.
- When selecting YNT Softweave in the Select Armor Mod dialog, it will now show "+50%" in the capacity field.
- Removed the button in Career mode that allowed adding more Mystic Adept Power Points. You're not actually allowed to add points this way after character creation.
- Added Custom Ballistic Mask.
- Added the specialized silencer for the Ares Light Fire 75 and added it to the Ares Light Fire 75.
- Added some very minor fixes for the underbarrel weapons from Run and Gun so at least they won't cause a crash.  They still don't behave the way I want them to though so I'll be revisiting this "soon".

Build 5.129 (beta)
- Qi Foci will now ask what power they're providing when you bind the foci and that power will now show up on your list of powers with the appropriate free levels if any and the name of the Qi Foci will be updated to show the power it is providing.  For Improved Reflexes, select the level you want your character to have and the foci rating, it will reduce the power point cost accordingly.
- Fixed a bug preventing weapons from being added to Heavy Weapon Mounts.
- Updated firearms that come stock with a Smartgun System to have the internal version.
- Added the Gas-Vent 2 System that the Ares Crusader II should have.
- Fixed the AP on the Colt M23.
- Manabolt is now correctly a Mana based spell.

Build 5.128 (beta)
- First and foremost, recent builds (including this one) have been getting updates to the French translation files courtesy of Lous_59. Thank you for your amazing work!
- Fixed a bug preventing loading bows or crossbows with ammunition in Career mode.
- Cleaned up the former Commlinks section on the Character Sheet.  It now is the Device section and each Commlink, RCC, or Cyberdeck shows itself as such.  Fixed a few problem items that were showing their stats incorrectly.
- Added device stat labels to cyberware, armor, weapon, gear, and vehicle tabs so that you can see the stats for selected commlinks, cyberdecks, or rigger command consoles.
- For newly created characters only, limit modifiers will now inlcude the condition under which they operate.  I'd make this retroactive but it would be a nightmare to code.
- Fixed the Quality Indomitable and the Adept Power Improved Potential to add directly to the calculated limits rather than add limit modifiers as these bonuses apply at all times.  This also resolved the issue with the Chaos Mentor Spirit where it was not applying the bonus from the granted Improved Potential power.
- Fixed a bug where in some cases carry-over karma from character creation would not be carried over.
- Will now automatically remove the Allergy when removing the Eagle Mentor Spirit.
- Fixed the Initiation/Submersion tab so that it will allow adding multiple instances of metamagics and echoes that allow it.
- Updated the Infusion of [Matrix Attribute] and Defusion of [Matrix Attribute] so that they will ask for you to enter the name of the attribute being adjusted.  For now it is a text entry, at some later date it may become a drop down.
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the karma calculation when increasing skills belonging to a broken skill group in creation mode.
- Updated the Select a Mentor Spirit dialog to not show choices you're not eligible for.  So Magician options won't show up for Adepts and Adept options won't show up for Magicians.  Mystic Adepts still see all options.

Build 5.127 (beta)
- Fixed a bug where it was not rounding Essence up when calculating your Social Limit.
- Fixed a bug which would prevent adding Sensor Functions to Sensors.
- Fixed a bug which would prevent any metamagics from being shown when selecting a new metamagic.

Build 5.126 (beta)
- Completely replaced the Initiation tab. It now should correctly handle Initiation (with discounts), Arts, Enchantments, Enhancements, Metamagics, and Rituals. Add an Initiation grade and then right click on the grade to add Arts, Enchantments, Enhancements, Metamagics, and Rituals.  In case you're not using Street Grimoire or choose not to use the Arts system, there is a new item on the House Rules tab of the Options dialog that you can use to ignore the Art requirements for metamagics and the like.
- Fixing the above item led to two powers referenced in Street Grimoire that haven't previously been published.  These have only been provided via a forum post by one of the designers.  So that post is now a source (SFP1) that can be enabled in order to provide those powers (Keratin Control and Living Focus).
- Updated all "Source" labels on all dialogs to open the linked PDF to that page if you have linked the book to the PDF in the Options dialog.  Also linked the names of skills and powers as they don't show a "Source" label in their listings.  And finally, the above mentioned forum post will open in your default browser if a Source pointing to it is clicked.
- Added the Small Unit Tactics Knowledge Skill from Run and Gun.
- Fixed a bug allowing the Seducer's Adept ability to allow any skill. It now restricts to the correct list. Thank you Ariketh for the solution!
- Fixed the Voice Control Adept power to allow for multiple levels.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when using YNT Softweave on an armor with an odd armor value.
- Added a variable price to Personalized Grip to reflect that it probably should cost something.
- Removed cyber-weapons from the Select a Weapon dialog. These can only be purchased now on the Select Cyberware dialog.
- Fixed a bug preventing the Respirator from being available to add to armor.
- Fixed a bug causing newly added Knowledge Skills to cap at 6 in career mode.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the tooltip on the button to increase your skill level to show the wrong value when in career mode and at rating 6.
- Fixed a bug that prevented adding Sensor Arrays (and quite a few other things) to vehicles while in Career mode.
- Adjusted the Select Weapon and Select Armor dialogs so that they'll have better performance.
- Fixed the price of the Monofilament Chainsaw.
- Fixed a multitude of bugs with the Complex Forms and Sprites tab in Career mode for Technomancers.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the wrong cost to be calculated for binding Counterspelling, Ritual Spellcasting, Spellcasting, or Sustaining Foci in Career mode.

Build 5.125 (beta)
- Fixed Damage and AP value for EXplosive Ammo
- Fixed a bug which would prevent the Dragonslayer Mentor Spirit from getting the bonus to a social skill.
- Added a separator between gear items attached to armor on the "Shadowrun 5" character sheets.
- Fixed a bug preventing refunding of Complex Form points when deleting a Complex Form.
- Weapons will now correctly inherit availability modifiers from accessories which should increase the weapon's availability.
- Removed 4th Edition artifact where Improved Physical Attribute was charging double for attributes raised above metatype max.
- Fixed a bug which could cause the movement formula to give incorrect values (it wasn't using the total value including augmentations).

Build 5.124 (beta)
- Fixed the crash non-US users were having when adding a Mentor Spirit.

Build 5.123 (beta)
- Fixed Security Armor: Heavy's armor rating.
- Added debug logging. By default this is turned off for performance reasons but if you encounter a significant error, I may ask you to turn it on so that the error can be captured and logged which will make my fixing the problem much easier.  If you do need to turn it on, you'll find it on the Options dialog listed as "Use Debug Logging".  For space reasons, if the log is turned on it will automatically clear itself each time you start Chummer.  At this time, only a small portion of Chummer's code is set up for debug logging but I'll be expanding this as I can.

Build 5.122 (beta)
- Fixed a number of bugs relating to Mentor Spirits and as best as I can tell, they're all working as intended. If you find otherwise, please email me a copy of your character sheet with a brief explanation of what's going wrong.
- Mountain Mentor Spirit now provides its bonus to Counterspelling
- Doom Mentor Spirit now correctly provides a +2 to the combat skill of your choice if you choose that option.
- Mutation Mentor Spirit now correctly asks for which ability to apply Attribute Boost.
- Eagle Mentor Spirit now automatically applies "Polutants" as the trigger of your Allergy.
- Dog Mentor Spirit now asks which senses are being improved.
- Moved the Smartgun System on the Savalette Guardian to be Internal.

Build 5.121 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that was preventing purchase of Binoculars (both digital and optical).
- Fixed a bug that was causing a soft crash when clicking on a weapon accessory.

Build 5.120 (beta)
- Updated the counters on the Build Summary tab to go into negative values if you use karma to overspend.  So if you have 3 contact points and add a 2/2 contact, it'll show "-1 of 3".
- Replaced the karma calculation for over-spending on Knowledge Skills. In short, the old mechanism was what was built in original Chummer and made you pay for the most expensive Knowledge Skill point from any of your Knowledge Skills when you went over. The new mechanism works just as the Active Skills (and Attributes) does meaning it looks for the cheapest possible option.  So if you had four points of Knowledge skills available and put 4 in skill A and 1 in skill B, the old method would charge you for raising skill A from 3 to 4 while the new method charges you to raise skill B to 1 (figuring out that the cheapest method is to put those four free points in skill A and pay karma for B).  This means that if you have an existing character still in character creation mode that spent karma on Knowledge Skills, you'll likely get some karma back.
- Fixed a bug that was incorrectly calculating your spent contact points.
- Fixing an issue with auto-update. I think this will stabilize auto-update and handle broken downloads better but I won't know for sure until we try.
- Fixed the price of the Redundant Power Supply.
- Changed Ares Predator V from External to Internal Smartgun System. This change will only apply on newly purchased Predators.

Build 5.119 (beta)
- Added Alchemical Preparations.
- Fixed a bug causing a crash when using Weapon Commlinks and Commlink Accessories.
- Fixed a bug that would improperly load adept powers if the character has more than one instance of that power.
- Fixed a bug with the Wolf Mentor Spirit that would cause a crash when selecting the Adept power.
- Fixed the capacity cost of Trodes.
- Fixed a bug that would excessively reduce the attribute minimum for Magic or Resonance when taking on an Essence reduction. This would cause Chummer to attempt to raise the attribute back to where it was by spending karma if need be.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Hand Blades from being available for purchase.
- Added a few more license options (based on Third Edition SR with the help of SpellBinder).
- Fixed a bug with audio enhancements (specifically the Audio Enhancement and Select Sound Filter) that weren't consuming capacity.

Build 5.118 (beta)
- Auto-update is back! For builds after 5.118 you'll be able to use the auto-update and check for update functionality to get new builds.
- Really fixed the Awaken spell so that it only appears once and has the correct book and page. Honestly, I got it this time!
- Removed the alternate Leadership and Arcana skills from 4th Edition.
- Fixed the weapon mounts on the Ares Duelist drone.
- Resolved the error on the Options dialog by setting the Shadowrun 5 sheet as the default if one isn't present.
- Adept powers will now sort by name when you load the character.
- Updated vehicles to allow adding any gear. This resolves several issues... First, being able to replace the standard sensors. Second, until we have vehicle capacity rules, there's really no programmatic means to say what does and does not belong in a car.

Build 5.117 (beta)
- Fixed a bug that could cause a bug while browsing weapons.

Build 5.116 (beta)
- Updated how Limit Modifiers work. In short, there are now two kinds. First, there's those provided by a specific source... for example the Indomitable quality. When you add the quality to or remove the quality from your character, it will automatically add or remove the limit modifier for you. Second, there's custom modifiers. These you add and remove yourself from the Limits tab.  I'm leaving this in place because there's always going to be some limit modifier I've left off and this gives one handy place to view and adjust your modifiers.  Unfortunately this does mean that limit modifiers on existing characters are going to be a problem.  You can however delete the existing limit modifiers, and then remove and re-add the items, qualities, powers, and so on that provide limit modifiers and this will add them back in correctly.
- Added a new Browse feature to the select Weapons and Armor dialogs. In the upper right corner of the dialog, there's a button marked "Browse". If you click it, you'll be shown a grid showing the items belonging to the selected category. You can sort the grid by clicking on the column headers. Otherwise it works the same as the list and you can switch back and forth as you like.
- Added a new Custom Item in Gear under the Custom category.  This item will ask you for a name and a price. You will be charged the amount you specify and the item will take on the name you give it, showing in your inventory as that name.  This should allow for any odd custom or table/campaign specifc item you may need.
- Added the content from Sail Away, Sweet Sister (SASS).
- Added the content from Stolen Souls (SS).
- Added the option to create Prime Runner and Street Level characters.
- Fixed the Demolitions bonus to the Doom mentor spirit.
- Updated the Exceptional Attribute quality to allow selection of Magic and Resonance.
- Fixed the availability calculation for Alpha/Beta/Deltaware for certain pieces of cyber and bioware.
- Removed the Throwing Weapons category from the Select Weapon dialog because these are all purchased as Gear.
- Added priority selection to the Text-Only character sheet.  This information will only appear for new characters created with version 5.116 or later.
- Fixed my own fix for limited spells. When I enabled limited spells to modify the DV of the spell, I accidentally broke the spells with drain greater than their force, for example Element Aura with its F+1 DV. This is now fixed properly.
- Removed the text entry when purchasing reagents.
- In light of the Personalized Grip, various holsters, and Spare Clips, I've updated all weapons to allow accessories. I may in the future add some more specialized handling of weapon accessories to be more specific to the weapon in question but for now this will at least allow usage of standard accessories.  In the end, while it's good if Chummer helps you follow the rules, it shouldn't prevent you from doing something that is legal within the rules.
- Fixed Social Modifiers for Voice Control (power), Tailored Pheromones (bioware), and Sleeping Tiger (armor).
- Fixed the karma costs of Foci during character advancement.
- Removed the Special menu item that would allow you to change your BP as it doesn't really make sense in 5th Edition.
- Reverted The Beast's Way and The Spiritual Way back to costing 20 karma AND added code so that if you have either of these qualities, you will not be charged to add a Mentor Spirit.  In Creation mode, you will be refunded the cost of your Mentor Spirit if you already have one. In Career mode you won't (you've already spent that karma).
- Updated the adept way qualities so that you may only pick one.
- During Career mode and as a Mystic Adept, taking Essence loss sufficient that it reduces your Magic score will also reduce your points allocated to Adept if they exceed your new Magic score.
- Fixed a bug which prevented a cyber weapon from using the Strength of the cyberlimb it is implanted within.
- Added Biotechnology to the Biotech skill group per the errata.
- Fixed Forgery by making it use Logic instead of Agility.
- Updated the character validator to not include the availability of Armor mods marked as "included in base armor" when determining the acceptability of the availability of the character's gear.
- Added Fetishes to Gear in the Magical Supplies category. They have no cost (and per the rules your character must create them) but this addition will enable you to show them in your inventory.
- Fixed a bug causing a character in Creation mode to show their starting nuyen instead of available nuyen on their character sheet.

Build 5.115 (beta)
- Added all of the remaining Street Grimoire content including Toxic Mentor Spirits, Blood Rituals, Insect Shaman tradition, Spirit Champion and Spirit Pariah Qualities, and Magical Items and Compounds.  If you find something that is missing, please let me know.
- Fixed Mentor Spirits with the Improved Ability adept power bonus which were causing a crash.
- Fixed a string bug that would cause a crash on Rituals using an Organic Link descriptor.
- Fixed the Ares Alpha by making its Smartgun System Internal rather than External.
- Fixed the various Cyber Implanted Guns by making their Smartgun System Internal rather than External.
- Fixed an error in the Select an Armor Mod dialog where some items allowed selecting a zero rating.
- Fixed an error in the Select an Armor Mod dialog where some items would cause a crash because they could be given a zero rating.
- Fixed Handheld Housing, Wall-Mounted Housing, Grenade-Cam, and Periscope Cam so that they can be purchased. Once purchased, you should be able to add a single sensor or sensor array (if you have enough capacity) and then populate the single sensor or sensor array with sensor functions. As best as I understand pages 445 and 446, this looks like how this is intended to function.
- Fixed an issue with vehicle sensors. Again, going by pages 445 and 446 and specifically the line "Most vehicles and drones come factory-equipped with a sensor array (at a rating listed with their stats)." I've set the rating of the Sensor Arrays for each vehicle equal to their sensor rating (or 2 if the vehicle/drone has a sensor rating of 1). If I got this wrong, please explain where I went wrong so I can correct it.
- Fixed the calculation for Unarmed Combat damage. Existing characters should delete and re-add their Unarmed Attack on the weapons list.
- Updated the license dialog to suggest more useful options. If you prefer the old method, you can turn it back on in the Options dialog on the Miscellaneous tab.  Either way, you can enter your own values by typing into the dropdown box.  For the XML inclined, you can add your own entries in licenses.xml. If you have suggestions for licenses to be included in the dropdown, send them to me.
- Updated Cool Resolve to provide its bonus to each of the Social skills.
- Fixed several bugs with the Enhanced Accuracy (skill) Adept Power. It was adding to the dice pool in error and not adding to the accuracy of weapons tied to that skill. Both of these issues have been resolved.
- Fixed a bug which would cause a weapon to not benefit from the correct skill.
- Cleaned up the tooltip for Initiative on the Other Information tab.
- Fixed the Matrix Initiative (Cold) calculated value.
- Fixed Limited spells so that they calculate the Drain Value correctly.
- Added 5th Edition Initiative values to the Other Info tab when in Career Mode.
- Removing the One Trick Pony quality will also remove the Martial Art. Removing the One Trick Pony Martial Art will also remove the Quality.

Build 5.114 (beta)
- Renamed the character sheets from "Shadowrun 4" to "Shadowrun 5".  If you're just copying the new version into the same directory, you'll want to delete the files in the \sheets subdirectory named "Shadowrun 4" with the .xsl or .xslt extention.
- Added new book Bullets & Bandages and its contents (BB).
- Fixed a bug that prevented karma from being charged if points were added to Magic in excess of the character's Special Attribute points.
- Updated the cost of The Beast's Way and The Spiritual Way to 15 points to reflect the free mentor spirit these qualities grant.
- Added a discount field below the Bonded Foci listing on the Gear tab that can be used to enter the number of foci qualifying for your Adept Way's foci bonding discount. This was the simplest and most straightforward way to handle the Adept Ways and the foci bonding discounts they might provide.
- Added a new Standard (Burnout's Way) cyberware/bioware grade that is enabled if you take the Burnout's Way quality. It is always available on the Cyberware and Bioware tab on the grade dropdown to handle cases where an Adept had the Burnout's Way, got cyber/bio, and later dropped the Burnout's Way in favor of another Way.
- Fixed a bug preventing the Suprathyroid Gland from increasing your lifestyle costs.
- Fixed Skills and Skill Groups so that if Ignore Rules was selected they cap at 99.
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash when selecting the Adept power for the Thunderbird Mentor Spirit.
- Fixed several bugs causing errors with the Urban Tribe Tomahawk.
- Fixed an artifact from 4th edition where Chummer was including Martial Arts when calculating the number of points spent on Positve Qualities.
- Fixed the missing Ingram Valiant.
- Fixed Unarmed Attack so that it is automatically added.
- Fixed the price of the SecureTech Vitals Kit.

Build 5.112 (beta)
- Added Rituals from Street Grimoire (SG).
- Added Metamagics from SG.
- Added Adept Ways from SG. I've included the discounts but just like Original Chummer, it's up to the player not to take more discounted powers than the 1 per 2 Magic. I will do a 2nd pass on the ways in the near future to restrict the discounts and to take a stab at adding the small bonuses the ways have like the karma discounts that some ways have as well as the cyberware essence discount that the Burnout's Way has and the skill bonus the Beast's Way has. For now, I was happy just getting the discounts working correctly.
- Fixed the price of the Yamaha Growler.
- Enabled the Spells and Spirits tab for Adepts. This allows Adepts to see the stats associated with their Mentor Spirit and to purchase Rituals. I'm currently omitting Rituals with the Spell keyword from the list they can purchase but will change this if it is appropriate to do so. I'm also omitting Rituals with the Adept keyword from the list for Magicians and Aspected Magicians.

- Fixed a bug preventing Cyberdecks from being added to a Cyberware Head Cyberdeck.
- Fixed a bug with the Horizon Flying Eye so that the variant with the Flash Pak and Smoke Grenade is correctly listed.
- Fixed a bug granting more Knowledge Skill points than proper. Was figuring on (INT + LOG) x 3 instead of x 2.
- Fixed the qualities that have ratings (Focused Concentration, High Pain Tolerance, etc...) to be listed in the Select Qualities dialog for each rating value.  Previously it was only allowing you to select the quality once, preventing reaching higher ratings. Unfortunately this means that if you pick Focused Concentration (Rating 2), rating 1 and 3 are still there in the list.  This isn't my optimal fix for this and I'm going to try to find something better. Suggestions are welcome.
- Updated Electrochromic Clothing to be an allowed mod for armor.

- Fixed karma costs for skill groups when buying more than your priority selection grants.
- Fixed karma costs for skills when buying more than your priority selection grants.
- Fixed karma costs for knowledge skills when buying more than your attributes grant. This uses the original code for calculating these costs which forces the player to pay for the most expensive points rather than what might be the most optimal.  As an example, if you have two knowledge skills named A and B and have 6 free knowledge skill points. If you set A at a value of 4 and B at 3, you'll use your 6 free points to raise them each to three and then pay karma to raise A to 4 costing you 4 karma. The optimal path would raise A to 4, B to 2, and then pay karma to raise B to 3 costing you 3 karma.  I've coded everything else (active skills, skill groups, and both primary and special attributes) to use the optimal path for paying karma for items raised beyond what your priorities provide for and wonder if it might be the right thing to do that here as well.
- Fixed character loading so that it loads the total available primary and special attributes per priority selection.
- Now ignores armor encumbrance (was a holdover from 4th edition).
- Fixed an issue where gear standard to a piece of armor wasn't showing up.
- Added the missing Home Ground positive quality.
- Added the missing Uneducated, Unsteady Hands, and Weak Immune System negative qualities.

- Removed the ability to add the Ambidextrous positive quality multiple times (this was a holdover from 4th edition where there was the ability to have more than 2 arms).
- Fixed the suprathyroid bioware so that it doesn't cause an error. There is a remaining issue where it isn't updating the lifestyle cost accordingly. This will be fixed in a future release.

Build 490

- fixed an issue where ammoreplace values for Weapons were not being handled correctly
- added an Option on the Miscellaneous tab: Karma cost for increasing Special Attributes is reduced with Essence Loss (see below)

Karma cost for increasing Special Attributes is reduced with Essence Loss
When the option is enabled, the Essence cost to improve MAG or RES is affected by Essence Loss. For example, the character an Essence Penalty of 1 and MAG of 3. Normally, Chummer calculates the cost based on its perceived MAG value of 4 (MAG 4 - Essence Penalty 1 = 3), meaning the cost of improving MAG would be for going from MAG 4 to MAG 5. With this option enabled, Chummer instead calculates the cost based on the shown value of 3, meaning the cost of improving MAG would be for going from MAG 3 to MAG 4. This only impacts Career Mode.

PDF Support
PDF support has been tested with both Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader. Clicking on a sourcebook field (such as SR4 324) will open the linked PDF to the appropriate page. PDF links can be configured in the Options window. There are a few things to note with each application in terms of behaviour. With Adobe Reader, a new instance of the application is opened each time you click on a PDF link in Chummer. If you have the SR4 book open already then click on another SR4 link, a new copy of Adobe Reader is opened to the appropriate page, meaning you will have multiple copies of the SR4 book open at the same time. With Foxit Reader, if you already have the SR4 book open and click on an SR4 link, Foxit Reader will gain focus but will not jump to the appropriate page. Foxit Reader will only jump to the appropriate page if you do not already have a copy of that PDF open. Unfortunately these are not things I can control; they are how these reader applications have been setup to behave.

Relative File Paths for Contacts and Spirits
Contacts and Spirits now support relative file paths for improved portability between computers. Chummer first looks for the exact file name that was linked. If it cannot be found, it falls back to using the relative path that was stored when the save file was linked to it. This will only work with save files that are linked in this and later versions of the application. In order to get this behaviour with previous save files, you will need to remove the link and re-link the save file to the Contact or Spirit.

Free-Style Create Mode
When 0 BP or 0 Karma is entered in the Choose BP Amount window, the Create window now lets you create a character with an unknown amount of BP/Karma. As BP/Karma is spent, the character's point total is automatically calculated. This also tracks the minimum amount of points the character must be based on the Primary Attributes in an attempt to enforce the rule of no more than 1/2 of the character's points total may be spent on Primary Attributes. The BP/Karma field will turn red when the character's Primary Attributes are forcing the character to be calculated at a higher point total than the number of points that have actually been spent.

For example, if your character has the Attribute Boost (STR) Adept Power at Rating 3, you can now create a Custom Improvement that will allow you to boost your STR when the Power is active, then set it back when you've deactivated it. See the Creating Custom Improvements page on the Chummer Wiki for more information.

Removable Metatype Qualities
Metatypes now have the ability to mark their starting Qualities as removable by setting the removable attribute to "true". These Qualities can be removed in Create Mode and Career Mode by selecting them and clicking the Delete Quality button. Removing these Qualities will cost the appropriate amount of BP or Karma. This is to allow Sapient Critters to buy off the Uncouth and Uneducated Qualities that they start with. This can be applied to older save files by locating the appropriate Quality and changing its <qualitysource> to MetatypeRemovable.

Adept Powers that Affect Base Attribute Scores
There has been a rather significant change (correction) to how a few Powers work in terms of affecting Attributes; namely Creative Eye, Improved Physical Attribute, and Keen Wits. The cost of these Powers were not being calculated correctly as they were not correctly modifying their Attributes' actual value, nor were they properly increasing the Karma cost of improving them in Career Mode. If your characters have any of these three Powers, you will need to remove them and re-add them so that things are calculated correctly.

Override Data Files
Similar to Custom Data Files, Override Data Files let you override individual items, replacing the base data with your own version (for example, changing the cost and damage for a Weapon). These follow the same naming rules as Custom Data Files but use "override" as their prefix (such as override_weapons.xml). Multiple Override files can exist for the same type (such as multiple Override files for Weapons), and the files are loaded in alphabetical order after loading the base data files. The item in the Override file completely replaces the base item. This is not intended to be used for holding your new custom data as the XML Manager will only overwrite existing items; it will not add items that do not exist in the base data files. Use at your own risk.

Settings Files
Chances are, most people are just going to stick with the default one and modify it as needed. For those who take part in multiple games where the sourcebooks allowed and optional rules used varies, you can create additional Settings files to keep all of this information separate. To create a new Setting, copy the default.xml file in the settings directory, rename the new copy to whatever you like, then modify it using the Options window. When you create a new character, Chummer asks you which Setting you would like to use (if more than 1 file exists). The name Settings file used is saved as part of the character file. You can change the Settings file a character uses by opening the save file in a text editor and changing the <settings /> tag to match the name of the desired file. These files can be given to players to make sure that everyone has the same set of options enabled.

About Omae
Omae is an online character repository where players and GMs can upload their creations to share with others who are looking for Contacts, Enemies, and Critters for their games. Anyone can download characters, but you must have a registered Omae account in order to upload characters. Registration is required so that people can see who put the effort into the character, search for other creations by that person, as well as allowing only the author to update a revised version of the character or delete it entirely. Registration is free and only asks for a user name and password. No other information is asked for or recorded. I have no use for that stuff. Password are encoded and stored in the online database. You may also choose to save your user name and password information locally so that you can log into Omae automatically when you open the window. Password are stored in an encoded format within the Windows Registry along with the other Chummer settings. When a character is downloaded, it is saved to your [Chummer path]\saves\omae directory.

Expense Undo Entries
This will be an ongoing project. By right-clicking on a Karma or Nuyen Expense, you can choose to undo the purchase. This will only be for Expenses that were created during the current session. They will not be saved with your character information, so once you have closed the character, the undo history is lost (largely to prevent undoing something done 10 game sessions ago without undoing anything else). Currently supported items - Karma: Attribute, Karma: Add Quality, Nuyen: Cyberware/Bioware, Nuyen: Gear. This only undoes the expense for the item you have selected. If you later added child items you should undo these expenses first - the undo function strictly undoes the single item that is selected, meaning anything that was added after and not undone will not be refunded. This is intended to undo your most recent few transactions only.

Free Spirit Characters
Magic replaces Force since they are the same Attribute for the Free Spirit. When you first create a Free Spirit character, your Attribute BP total will be very high but is technically correct. All of the character's Attribute start at 2 and have a Metatype Maximum of 2 (the Free Spirit's starting Force/Magic). This means that all of your Attribute costs are being calculated at their Metatype Maximum which adds +15BP per Attribute. (This technically breaks all of the other written rules saying only 1 Physical/Mental Attribute can be at it's Metatype Maximum.) When MAG 3 or higher is selected, this number drops back down since they are all no longer at their Metatype Maximum. (And who would play a Force 2 Free Spirit anyways?)

A.I. Characters
Resonance replaces Rating. Their free Programs can be purchased through Gear by selecting the Free! checkbox when purchasing.

- Elemental Strike and Elemental Resistance Adept Powers now ask for a value to be selected
- <specificattribute /> Improvements now include support for precedence attribute which determines how they stack with other Improvements to the same Attribute (see below)

specificattribute precedence
This has been included to (and should only be used for) Cyberware, Bioware, and Powers that affect Initiative and/or Reaction which either does not allow it to stack with any other enhancement, or only certain ones. A precedence of 1 ignore all other Improvements and uses the COMBINED value of all other precedence 1 items (Wired Reflexes, Move-by-Wire, and Reaction Enhancers). A precedence of 0 ignore all other Improvements and uses the single highest precedence 0 Improvement the character has (Synaptic Booster). Short version: nothing you need to actually worry about - the necessary items have already been updated and Chummer figures out what it should use. :)

Changes to Qualities
Qualities have undergone a complete re-write. Existing character will convert their Qualities over to the new format when they are loaded. It is recommended that you immediately save your character after opening it to keep these Quality changes. The code to convert these Qualities will be removed around June 20 (update notes will be posted to inform of the change). Qualities are now handled like other items in that they can be added/removed using the Add and Delete buttons and are listed in a single tree. The Select a Quality window by default lists only the Qualities that the character may take - a checkbox is provided to show all Qualities, regardless of qualification.

Custom Data Files
You can create custom data for each of the data files. To being, create a copy of an existing file and add "custom_" to its name. For example, to create custom Cyberware date, you would create a copy of cyberware.xml and rename it custom_cyberware.xml. This will give you the structure that the application expects. You can then create your custom items using the custom data file. The <version> information can be safely removed since it does not apply. Your custom information will be shown along with the application's own data where applicable.
